		<field name="AB">Plantago (Plantaginaceae) is an herbal plant, which is used in folk medicine, functional food, and dietary supplement products. Recent pharmacological and phytochemical studies have shown that polysaccharides isolated from Plantago have multiple medicinal and nutritional benefits, including improve intestinal health, hypoglycemic effect, immunomodulatory effect, etc. These health and pharmacological benefits are of great interest to the public, academia, and biotechnology industries. This paper provides an overview of recent advances in the physicochemical, structural features, and biological effects of Plantago polysaccharides and highlights the similarities and differences of the polysaccharides from different species and in different parts, including leaves, seeds, and husks. The scientific support for its use as a prebiotic is also addressed. The purpose of this review is to provide background as well as useful and up-to-date information for future research and applications of these polysaccharides. © 2021</field>

		<field name="AB">Artificial sweeteners (AS) have been widely used as sugar substitutes to reduce calorie intake. However, it was reported that high doses of AS induced glucose intolerance via modulating gut microbiota. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of lower doses of sucralose on fecal microbiota in obesity. Eight weeks after high-fat diet (HFD), the male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (6 in each group) and administrated by a daily gavage of 2 ml normal saline (CON), 0.54 mM sucralose (N054), 0.78 mM sucralose (N078), and 324 mM sucrose (S324), respectively. After 4 weeks, fecal samples were obtained and analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. The richness and diversity of fecal microbiota were not changed by sucralose or sucrose. Both 0.54 mM (0.43 mg) and 0.78 mM (0.62 mg) sucralose tended to reduce the beneficial bacteria, Lactobacillaceae and Akkermansiaceae. The relative abundance of family Acidaminoccaceae and its genus Phascolarctobacteriam were increased after 0.54 mM sucralose. In functional prediction, 0.54 mM sucralose increased profiles of carbohydrate metabolism, whereas 0.78 mM sucralose enhanced those of amino acid metabolism. The lower doses of sucralose might alter the compositions of fecal microbiota. The effects of sucralose in different dosages should be considered in the future study.

		<field name="AB">Palygorskite (Pal), a clay nanoparticle, has been demonstrated to be a vehicle for drug delivery. Copper has antibacterial properties, and zinc is an essential micronutrient for intestinal health in animals and humans. However, whether copper/zinc-modified Pal (Cu/Zn-Pal) can protect chickens from Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) infection remains unclear. In this study, three complexes (Cu/Zn-Pal-1, Cu/Zn-Pal-2, and Cu/Zn-Pal-3) were prepared, and Cu/Zn-Pal-1 was shown to be the most effective at inhibiting the growth of S. Typhimurium in vitro, whereas natural Pal alone had no inhibitory effect. In vivo, Cu/Zn-Pal-1 reduced S. Typhimurium colonization in the intestine of infected chickens and relieved S. Typhimurium-induced organ and intestinal mucosal barrier damage. Moreover, this reduction in Salmonella load attenuated intestinal inflammation and the oxidative stress response in challenged chickens. Additionally, Cu/Zn-Pal-1 modulated the intestinal microbiota in infected chickens, which was characterized by the reduced abundance of Firmicutes and the increased abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Our results indicated that the Cu/Zn-Pal-1 complex may be an effective feed supplement for reducing S. Typhimurium colonization of the gut.

		<field name="AB">This study aimed to determine the carboxymethylation effect of crude water-soluble polysaccharides of Passiflora edulis peel (WPEP), xylan (XY), and citrus pectin (CP). Their chemical and pre-biotic properties were also determined. The polysaccharides were carboxymethylated by reacting with chloroacetic acid and sodium hydroxide. The carboxymethylated and non-carboxymethylated polysaccharides were also used as pre-biotics to study the growth pattern of selected intestinal microflora. These polysaccharides substituted the glucose solution in culture media for culturing Lactobacillus brevis GIM1.773, Lactobacillus plantarum GIM1.19, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus GIM1.155, and Streptococcus thermophilus GIM1.540. The results showed that the carboxymethylated polysaccharides c-XY, c-CP, and c-WPEP, had substitution degrees of 0.682, 0.437, and 0.439, respectively. The polysaccharides demonstrated resistance to digestion in the simulated human digestive models. The resistance to digestion was enhanced by carboxymethylation, especially the carboxymethylated CP and WPEP. The results also showed that the pre-biotic activities of the polysaccharides increased after carboxymethylation. The c-XY had a better pre-biotic effect than XY and the other carbohydrate samples. The findings suggested that carboxymethylated polysaccharides may be developed into novel pre-biotics and nutraceuticals that could promote growth of the probiotic strains.

		<field name="AB">Honeybees (Apis mellifera) can be exposed via numerous potential pathways to ambient nanoparticles (NPs), including rare earth oxide (REO) NPs that are increasingly used and released into the environment. Gut microorganisms are pivotal in mediating honeybee health, but how REO NPs may affect honeybee health and gut microbiota remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, honeybees were fed pollen and sucrose syrup containing 0, 1, 10, 100, and 1000mgkg−1 of nano-La2O3 for 12days. Nano-La2O3 exerted detrimental effects on honeybee physiology, as reflected by dose-dependent adverse effects of nano-La2O3 on survival, pollen consumption, and body weight (p&amp;lt;0.05). Nano-La2O3 caused the dysbiosis of honeybee gut bacterial communities, as evidenced by the change of gut bacterial community composition, the enrichment of pathogenic Serratia and Frischella, and the alteration of digestion-related taxa Bombella (p&amp;lt;0.05). There were significant correlations between honeybee physiological parameters and the relative abundances of pathogenic Serratia and Frischella (p&amp;lt;0.05), underscoring linkages between honeybee health and gut bacterial communities. Taken together, this study demonstrates that nano-La2O3 can cause detrimental effects on honeybee health, potentially by disordering gut bacterial communities. This study thus reveals a previously overlooked effect of nano-La2O3 on the ecologically and economically important honeybee species Apis mellifera.

		<field name="AB">Background and Aim: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogenic microorganisms have become a global problem in ruminants as a result of the intensive use of antibiotics, causing the development of resistance among gut microbiota. The antibiotic-resistant microorganisms can be transferred from diseased animals to humans. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MDR Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. isolated from cattle, buffaloes, sheep, and goats suffering from respiratory signs, diarrhea, and mastitis and to screen the antibiotic sensitivity of selected isolated bacteria. It also detected antibiotic-resistance genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), produced green gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using plant extracts (Artemisia herba-alba and Morus alba), and evaluated the antimicrobial activities of these biosynthesized nanoparticles on selected pathogens (E. coli and Salmonella spp.). Materials and Methods: MDR E. coli and Salmonella spp. were investigated using fecal samples (n=408), nasal swabs (n=358), and milk samples (n=227) of cattle, buffaloes, sheep, and goats with or without clinical signs, including respiratory manifestations, pneumonia, diarrhea, and mastitis, from different governorates in Egypt. E. coli and Salmonella spp. were isolated and identified on selective media, which were confirmed by biochemical reactions and PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing against 10 commonly used antibiotics was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Antibiotic resistance genes blaTEM blaSHV blaOXA, and blaCTX−M were detected by PCR. The antibacterial effect of the,, biosynthesized AuNPs was evaluated by MIC and well diffusion assay. The biosynthesized AuNPs were also characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results: Among all fecal samples, the prevalence of E. coli was 18.4% (183/993) and that of Salmonella spp. was 16.7% (66/408), as determined by cultural and molecular tests. All isolates of E. coli and Salmonella spp. were 100% resistant to ampicillin (AM) and amoxicillin and highly resistant to cefoxitin and AM-sulbactam. The total rate of resistance genes in E. coli was 61.2% (112/183), while that in Salmonella was 63.6% (42/66) for pathogens isolated from ruminants with respiratory manifestations, pneumonia, diarrhea, and mastitis. Among the resistance genes, blaTEM had the highest prevalence rate in E. coli (25.9%, 21/81) while blaSHV had the lowest (9.8%, 8/81) in fecal swabs. AuNPs were successfully synthesized using aqueous leaf extract of A. herba-alba and M. alba as bioreducing agents. TEM analysis showed particle size of 10-42 nm for A. herba-alba and M. alba AuNPs. The biosynthesized AuNPs showed antibacterial activity against MDR E. coli and Salmonella spp. Conclusion: Rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are the cornerstone for effective treatment to reduce the risk of antimicrobial-resistant pathogenic microorganisms. This is particularly important for overcoming the increasing rate of MDR in ruminants with respiratory manifestations, pneumonia, diarrhea, and mastitis. This can be complemented by the development of AuNPs synthesized in an environmentally friendly manner AuNPs using natural plant extracts for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.

		<field name="AB">This study aimed to extract polysaccharides from pumpkin, characterize the structures of four of them, and evaluate their in vitro antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities. Additionally, an animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was established and used to determine their hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects in vivo, and the underlying mechanisms related to the regulation of gut microbiota. Water-extracted crude pumpkin polysaccharides (W-CPPs), water extraction and alcohol precipitation crude pumpkin polysaccharides (WA-CPPs), deproteinized pumpkin polysaccharides (DPPs), and refined pumpkin polysaccharides (RPPs) were sequentially extracted and purified from pumpkin powder by hot water extraction, water extraction, and alcohol precipitation, deproteinization and DEAE-52 cellulose gel column, respectively. The extraction and purification methods had significant influence on the extraction yield, physicochemical properties, and in vitro antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities. W-CCP and RPPs had a significant positive free radical-scavenging capacities and inhibitory activities on α-glucosidase and α-amylase. RPP-3 not only inhibited the uptake of glucose in Caco-2 monolayer but also promoted the excretion of glucose, while RPP-2 had no inhibitory effect. Animal experiment results showed that W-CPP treatment significantly improved the T2DM symptoms in mice, which included lowering of fasting blood glucose (FBG), reducing insulin resistance (IR), and lowering of blood lipid levels. It increased the diversity of intestinal flora and reduced the harmful flora of model mice, which included Clostridium, Thermoanaerobe, Symbiotic bacteria, Deinococcus, Vibrio haematococcus, Proteus gamma, and Corio. At the family level, W-CPP (1,200 mg/kg) treatment significantly reduced the abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae, and the Akkermanaceae of Verrucobacterium became a biomarker. Pumpkin polysaccharides reshaped the intestinal flora by reducing Erysipelotrichaceae and increasing Akkermansia abundance, thereby improving blood glucose and lipid metabolism in the T2DM mice. Our results suggest that W-CCP and RPP-3 possess strong antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities, and are potential candidates for food additives or natural medicines. © Copyright © 2021 Wu, Ma, Zhang, Wu, Guo, Yang and Li.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background and Aim: Europe and the USA have banned antibiotics use as growth promoters. There is a need for alternative products that can ensure production and health protection. Prebiotics has been proposed as alternatives because these materials have wide-ranging physiological effects on gut function, activity of the large intestinal microflora, mineral absorption, and immunity. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of three different doses of inulin, a prebiotic, in combination with probiotic Enterococcus faecium (a new synbiotic) on postnatal rumen development by comparing rumen papilla length, width, muscle layer thickness, and content pH level. Materials and Methods: Randomly selected 23 (±5)-days-old healthy male Holstein crossbreed calves, weighing 50 kg (±5 kg), were randomly allocated to seven groups, ten in each group. The calves were kept in a pen of 5, under the same conditions and were fed twice a day, ~3.5 liters of whole milk per feeding. Control group (C n=10) was fed with whole milk only (no additives were added). The six other groups (three prebiotics and three synbiotics) received food additives with their morning milk feeding. The source of prebiotics, Jerusalem artichoke powder concentrate (JAPC) contained 50% of inulin. JAPC in doses of 6 g, 12 g, or 24 g were added to the milk. Formed prebiotic groups were denoted as PreG6, PreG12, and PreG24. To evaluate if the addition of the probiotic E. faecium 2×109 colony forming unit g−1 to manufacturer recommended dose of 0.25 g improves inulin effect on rumen, it was added to all their JAPC doses. The new content synbiotic groups were denoted as SynG6, SynG12, and SynG24. On day 57 of the study, when all calves were approximately 12 weeks old, they were slaughtered in a certified slaughterhouse. Tissue cultures for histological analysis were obtained from Saccus dorsalis and Saccus ventralis of the rumen. Tissue culture staining for histology was carried out using hematoxylin and eosin staining method. Rumen histological samples were used to measure papilla length, width, and muscle layer thickness. Each sample was used to make five measurements on the present rumen papilla. Results: The results showed that by adding 12 g of inulin to whole milk when feeding calves improves rumen papilla development, which is seen by increased length and width of papilla, especially in the Saccus ventralis region. By combing this dose of inulin with 0.25 g of E. faecium, a significant increase of papilla is achieved. Saccus ventralis muscle layer in the rumen is thicker than it is in Saccus dorsalis regardless of addition of prebiotics or synbiotics. Conclusion: The addition of inulin to whole milk can influence the pH of the rumen by making it more alkaline. The addition of prebiotic inulin and a novel synbiotic (inulin combined with E. faecium) can accelerate postnatal rumen development and improve its functionality. Copyright: © Arne and Ilgaza.

		<field name="AB">1 Abstract: Diet is one of the most important factors regulating and influencing the composition of our gut microbiome, but the specific effects of commonly used antimicrobial agents i.e., food preservatives present within foods, are not completely understood. In this study, we examined the effect of the three widely used food-grade preservatives i.e., benzoic acid, potassium sorbate, and sodium nitrite, in recommended levels, on the gut microbiota diversity and composition in a mouse model. The analysis of β-diversity reveals distinct signatures of the gut microbiota between mice consuming different preservatives. Further analyses of α-diversity indices also show that the three preservatives induce specific patterns of microbial diversity, with diversity being lowest in mice consuming potassium sorbate. In terms of bacterial abundance, each of the three preservatives demonstrated unique microbial signatures, mainly affecting the proportions of bacterial taxa belonging to Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Proteobacteria. Specifically, we find the increased proportion of Bacteroides, Blautia, Ruminococcus, Oscillospira, and Dorea in mice fed with benzoate; increased abundance of Firmicutes, Turicibacter, and Alkaliphilus by sodium nitrate; and increased proportion of Parabacteroides and Adlercreutzia by potassium sorbate. The findings improve our understanding of how food-grade preservatives may influence the gut microbiota composition and diversity and should facilitate prospective studies investigating diet-microbiome interactions in relation to intestinal and metabolic health. © 2021 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Alterations in the brain-gut system have been implicated in various disease states, but little is known about how early-life adversity (ELA) impacts development and adult health as mediated by brain-gut interactions. We hypothesize that ELA disrupts components of the brain-gut system, thereby increasing susceptibility to disordered mood. In a sample of 128 healthy adult participants, a history of ELA and current stress, depression, and anxiety were assessed using validated questionnaires. Fecal metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomic profiling. Functional brain connectivity was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. Sparse partial least squares-discriminant analysis, controlling for sex, body mass index, age, and diet was used to predict brain-gut alterations as a function of ELA. ELA was correlated with four gut-regulated metabolites within the glutamate pathway (5-oxoproline, malate, urate, and glutamate gamma methyl ester) and alterations in functional brain connectivity within primarily sensorimotor, salience, and central executive networks. Integrated analyses revealed significant associations between these metabolites, functional brain connectivity, and scores for perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. This study reveals a novel association between a history of ELA, alterations in the brain-gut axis, and increased vulnerability to negative mood and stress. Results from the study raise the hypothesis that select gut-regulated metabolites may contribute to the adverse effects of critical period stress on neural development via pathways related to glutamatergic excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. © 2021</field>

		<field name="AB">Bacteriocins are narrow-spectrum protein antibiotics that could potentially be used to engineer the human gut microbiota. However, technologies for targeted delivery of proteins to the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract in preclinical animal models are currently lacking. In this work, we have developed methods for the microencapsulation of Escherichia coli targeting bacteriocins, colicin E9 and Ia, in a pH responsive formulation to allow their targeted delivery and controlled release in an in vivo murine model of E. coli colonization. Membrane emulsification was used to produce a water-in-oil emulsion with the water-soluble polymer subsequently cross-linked to produce hydrogel microcapsules. The microcapsule fabrication process allowed control of the size of the drug delivery system and a near 100% yield of the encapsulated therapeutic cargo. pH-triggered release of the encapsulated colicins was achieved using a widely available pH-responsive anionic copolymer in combination with alginate biopolymers. In vivo experiments using a murine E. coli intestinal colonization model demonstrated that oral delivery of the encapsulated colicins resulted in a significant decrease in intestinal colonization and reduction in E. coli shedding in the feces of the animals. Employing controlled release drug delivery systems such as that described here is essential to enable delivery of new protein therapeutics or other biological interventions for testing within small animal models of infection. Such approaches may have considerable value for the future development of strategies to engineer the human gut microbiota, which is central to health and disease. © Copyright © 2021 Carpena, Richards, Bello Gonzalez, Bravo-Blas, Housden, Gerasimidis, Milling, Douce, Malik and Walker.</field>

		<field name="AB">White kidney beans contain α-amylase inhibitors that can be used in diet for weight reduction. In this study, we investigated the potential of white kidney bean (phaseolus vulgaris L.) extract enriched in α-amylase inhibitor as a food additive in yogurt to regulate blood glucose in hyperglycemic animals. Five groups of C57BL/6J mice were fed for 8 weeks with standard chow diets, high-fat diets (HFD), or high-fat diets with supplement of α-amylase inhibitor in white kidney beans (P. vulgaris extract, PVE), yogurt (Y), and PVE added yogurt (YPVE), respectively. The HFD weakened glucose tolerance and caused insulin resistance in mice, and changed the characteristics of intestinal flora. The intervention of Y, PVE, and YPVE decreased blood glucose, insulin, hyperlipidemia, and inflammatory cytokine levels in mice fed with HFD. Moreover, the YPVE could regulate the components of host intestinal microbiota toward a healthy pattern, significantly increased the metabolic-related flora Corynebacterium, Granulicatella, and Streptococcus, while it decreased Paraprevotella and Allobaculum. Thus, YPVE markedly increased functions of “Amino Acid Metabolism,” “Energy Metabolism,” “Nucleotide Metabolism,” and declined functions of “Glycan Biosynthesis and Metabolism.” Consequently, YPVE could be developed as a new functional food because of its beneficial prebiotic properties in the metabolic syndrome. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Guo, Xing, Li, Yang, Zhang, Ren, Chen and Mi.</field>

		<field name="AB">The aim of the study was to investigate the regulatory effects of policosanol on hyperlipidemia, gut microbiota and metabolic status in a C57BL/6 mouse model. A total of 35 C57BL/6 mice were assigned to 3 groups, chow (n=12), high fat diet (HFD, n=12) and HFD+policosanol (n=11), then treated for 18 weeks. Policosanol supplementation significantly reduced serum triglycerides and total cholesterol, as well as the weight of brown adipose tissue (BAT) (p&lt;0.05), without affecting body weight in HFD-fed mice (p&gt;0.05). Combined 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomic analysis demonstrated that policosanol had regulatory effects on gut microbiota and serum metabolism in mice. In obese mice, policosanol increased the proportion of Bacteroides, decreased the proportion of Firmicutes, and increased the ratio of Bacteroides to Firmicutes (p&lt;0.05). Policosanol promoted lipolysis and thermogenesis process, including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and pyruvate cycle, correlated with the increasing level of Bacteroides, Parasutterella, and decreasing level of Lactobacillus and Candidatus_Saccharimonas. Moreover, policosanol decreased fatty acid synthase (FAS) in the iWAT of obese mice. Policosanol also increased peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), uncoupling Protein-1 (UCP-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) obese mice (p&lt;0.05). This study presents the new insight that policosanol may inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids, and promote lipolysis, thermogenesis related gene expression and regulate gut microbiota constituents, which provides potential for policosanol as an antihyperlipidemia functional food additive and provide new evidence for whole grain food to replace refined food. © Copyright © 2021 Zhai, Liu, Niu, Lin, Tu, Liu, Cai, Liu and Ouyang.</field>

		<field name="AB">Mogroside V (MV), a sweetener, is one of the major components inSiraitia grosvenorii. In our research, after in vitro incubation with MV for 24 h, the human gut microbiota diversity changed, with an enrichment of the genera Bacteroides, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, Megasphaera, and Olsenella and the inhibition of Clostridium XlVa, Dorea, and Desulfovibrio. Moreover, the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids, such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, was increased by gut microbiota. According to ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) analysis, MV was decomposed into secondary mogrosides, such as mogroside II/I and mogrol, by gut microbiota. Enhanced antioxidant abilities of the metabolites were found in the broth.

		<field name="AB">In the present study, we evaluated the effects of administering Enterococcus faecium in food and/or water on the hematological and immunological parameters, intestinal microbiota, resistance to bacterial diseases (streptococcosis and francisellosis) and growth of Nile tilapia. Before the in vivo experiment, probiotic bacteria isolated from Nile tilapia were selected via inhibition tests. Sequencing, annotation, and assembly of the complete genome of the selected bacteria as well as other tests were performed using bioinformatics tools. Three treatments were implemented: G1 (probiotic feeding), G2 (probiotic in water), and G3 (probiotic in food and water); and a negative control (NC) was also employed. Treatment lasted 38 days, and each group consisted of fish and two repetitions. The fish were divided and infected with Streptococcus agalactiae S13 (serotype Ib) and Francisella orientalis. The G1 group had a higher average final weight gain than the G2, G3, and NC groups. Further, a significant increase in the number of thrombocytes was observed in the groups administered probiotics in the diet (G1 and G3). A statistical difference was observed in the mortality of fish infected with S. agalactiae in the NC compared to the treated groups. Cetobacterium was the 43 most abundant genus in the intestinal microbiota of all groups, including the NC group. E. faecium increased the immunity of fish administered the treatment and decreased the mortality caused by S. agalactiae. As an autochtone probiotic, E. faecium does not interfere with the local ecosystem and thus has a great probiotic potential for Nile tilapia in Brazil. © Copyright © 2021 Suphoronski, de Souza, Chideroli, Mantovani Favero, Ferrari, Ziemniczak, Gonçalves, Lopera Barrero and Pereira.</field>

		<field name="AB">The human gut microbiome is currently recognized to play a vital role in human biology and development, with diet as a major modulator. Therefore, novel indigestible polysaccharides that confer a health benefit upon their fermentation by the microbiome are under investigation. Based on the recently demonstrated prebiotic potential of a carrot-derived pectin extract enriched for rhamnogalacturonan I (cRG-I), the current study aimed to assess the impact of cRG-I upon repeated administration using the M-SHIME technology (3 weeks at 3g cRG-I/d). Consistent effects across four simulated adult donors included enhanced levels of acetate (+21.1 mM), propionate (+17.6 mM), and to a lesser extent butyrate (+4.1 mM), coinciding with a marked increase of OTUs related to Bacteroides dorei and Prevotella species with versatile enzymatic potential likely allowing them to serve as primary degraders of cRG-I. These Bacteroidetes members are able to produce succinate, explaining the consistent increase of an OTU related to the succinate-converting Phascolarctobacterium faecium (+0.47 log10 (cells/mL)). While the Bifidobacteriaceae family remained unaffected, a specific OTU related to Bifidobacterium longum increased significantly upon cRG-I treatment (+1.32 log10 (cells/mL)). Additional monoculture experiments suggested that Bifidobacterium species are unable to ferment cRG-I structures as such and that B. longum probably feeds on arabinan and galactan side chains of cRG-I, released by aforementioned Bacteroidetes members. Overall, this study confirms the prebiotic potential of cRG-I and additionally highlights the marked consistency of the microbial changes observed across simulated subjects, suggesting the involvement of a specialized consortium in cRG-I fermentation by the human gut microbiome. © 2021 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) seriously affects children’s health, while the gut microbiome has been widely hypothesized to be involved in the regulation of ASD behavior. This study investigated and compared the number, diversity, and population structure of gut microbiota between healthy and ASD children and their susceptibility to zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) based on the measurement of live cell number, living/dead bacterial staining test, flow cytometry observation and bacterial community analysis using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The result of this present study revealed that ASD children not only significantly reduced the live cell number and the community diversity of gut bacteria, but also changed the gut bacterial community composition compared to the healthy children. In addition, this result revealed that ZnONPs significantly reduced the number of live bacterial cells in the gut of healthy children, but not in that of ASD children. In contrast, ZnONPs generally increased the gut bacterial community diversity in both ASD and healthy children, while a greater increase was found in ASD children than that of healthy children. Furthermore, this study successfully isolated and identified some representative nanoparticle-resistant bacteria based on the color, shape, and edge of colony as well as the 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The community of nanoparticle-resistant bacteria differed in between healthy and ASD children. Indeed, the representative strains 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 and 6-4 from healthy children were identified as Bacillus anthracis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli with sequence similarity of 97.86%, 99.86%, 99.03% and 99.65%, respectively, while the representative strains 8-1, 8-2 and 8-3 from ASD children were identified as Bacillus cereus, with sequence similarities of 99.58%, 99.72% and 99.72%, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrated that ZnONPs caused a change in number, diversity, and species composition of gut bacteria, but differed in healthy and ASD children. © 2021 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Throughout their life cycle, bacteria shed portions of their outermost membrane comprised of proteins, lipids, and a diversity of other biomolecules. These biological nanoparticles have been shown to have a range of highly diverse biological activities, including pathogenesis, community regulation, and cellular defense (among others). In recent publications, we have isolated and characterized membrane vesicles (MVs) from several species of Lactobacilli, microbes classified as commensals within the human gut microbiome (Dean et al., 2019 and 2020). With increasing scientific understanding of host-microbe interactions, the gut-brain axis, and tailored probiotics for therapeutic or performance increasing applications, the protocols described herein will be useful to researchers developing new strategies for gut community engineering or the targeted delivery of bio-active molecules.

		<field name="AB">While many beneficial host–microbiota interactions have been described, imbalanced microbiota in the gut is speculated to contribute to the progression and recurrence of chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn’s disease (CD). This in vitro study evaluated the impact of a cranberry concentrate Type M (CTM) on adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) LF82, a pathobiont associated with CD. Different stages of pathogenic infection were investigated: (i) colonization of the mucus layer, and (ii) adhesion to and (iii) invasion of the epithelial cells. Following 48 h of fecal batch incubation, 0.5 and 1 mM of CTM significantly altered AIEC LF82 levels in a simulated mucus layer, resulting in a decrease of 50.5% in the untreated blank, down to 43.0% and 11.4%, respectively. At 1 mM of CTM, the significant decrease in the levels of AIEC LF82 coincided with a stimulation of the metabolic activity of the background microbiota. The increased levels of health-associated acetate (+7.9 mM) and propionate levels (+3.5 mM) suggested selective utilization of CTM by host microor-ganisms. Furthermore, 1 mM of both fermented and unfermented CTM decreased the adhesion and invasion of human-derived epithelial Caco-2 cells by AIEC LF82. Altogether, this exploratory in vitro study demonstrates the prebiotic potential of CTM and supports its antipathogenic effects through direct and/or indirect modulation of the gut microbiome. © 2021 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Increasing insight into the impact of the gut microbiota on human health has sustained the development of novel prebiotic ingredients. This exploratory study evaluated the prebiotic potential of baobab fruit pulp powder, which consists of pectic polysaccharides with unique composition as compared to other dietary sources, given that it is rich in low methoxylated homogalacturonan (HG). After applying dialysis procedures to remove simple sugars from the product (simulating their ab-sorption along the upper gastrointestinal tract), 48 h fecal batch incubations were performed. Baobab fruit pulp powder boosted colonic acidification across three simulated human adult donors due to the significant stimulation of health-related metabolites acetate (+18.4 mM at 48 h), propionate (+5.5 mM at 48 h), and to a lesser extent butyrate (0.9 mM at 48 h). Further, there was a trend of increased lactate levels (+2.7 mM at 6h) and reduced branched chain fatty acid (bCFA) levels (−0.4 mM at 48 h). While Bacteroidetes levels increased for all donors, donor-dependent increases in Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli, and Firmicutes were observed, stressing the potential interindividual differences in microbial composition modulation upon Baobab fruit pulp powder treatment. Overall, Baobab fruit pulp powder fermentation displayed features of selective utilization by host microorganisms and, thus, has promising prebiotic potential (also in comparison with the ‘gold standard’ prebiotic inulin). Further research will be required to better characterize this prebiotic potential, accounting for the interindividual differences, while aiming to unravel the potential resulting health benefits. © 2021 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Understanding mechanisms governing the resistance and resilience of microbial communities is essential for predicting their ecological responses to environmental disturbances. Although we have a good understanding of such issues for soil and lake ecosystems, how ecological resistance and resilience regulate the microbiota in the fish gut ecosystem remains unclear. Using the zebrafish model, we clarified the potential mechanisms governing the gut microbiota after exposure to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). Here, we explored the ecological resistance and resilience of gut microbiota in zebrafish exposed to different concentrations of AgNPs (i.e., 10, 33 and 100 mg/liter) for 15, 45, 75 days. The high-throughput sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene showed that AgNP exposure significantly reduced the a-diversity of gut microbiota and resulted in obvious dynamics of community composition and structure. However, the rebound of zebrafish gut microbiota was pushed toward an alternative state after 15 days of AgNP exposure. We found that homogeneous selection was a more prevalent contributor in driving gut community recovery after AgNP exposure. The resilience and resistance of gut microbiota responses to AgNP disturbance might be mainly determined by the predominant keystone taxa such as Acinetobacter and Gemmata. This study not only expanded our understanding of fish gut microbiota's responses to pollutants but also provided new insights into maintaining host-microbiome stability during environmental perturbations. © 2021 Chen et al.</field>

		<field name="AB">The past decade has seen increasing interest in microbiota-targeting therapeutic strategies that aim to modulate the gut microbiota’s composition and/or function to treat chronic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), metabolic symptoms, and obesity. While targeting the gut microbiota is an innovative means for treating IBD, it typically requires an extended treatment time, hampering its potential application. Herein, using an established natural-lipid nanoparticle (nLNP) platform, we demonstrate that nLNPs encapsulated with the drug candidate 6-shogaol (6S/nLNP) distinctly altered microbiota composition within one day of treatment, significantly accelerating a process that usually requires five days using free 6-shogaol (6S). In addition, the change in the composition of the microbiota induced by five-day treatment with 6S/nLNP was maintained for at least 15 days (from day five to day 20). The consequent alteration in the fecal metabolic profile stemming from this compositional change manifested as functional changes that enhanced the in vitro anti-inflammatory and wound-healing efficacy of macrophage cells (Raw 264.7) and epithelial cells (Caco-2 BBE1), respectively. Further, this metabolic compositional change, as reflected in an altered metabolic profile, promoted a robust anti-inflammatory effect in a DSS-induced mouse model of acute colitis. Our study demonstrates that, by near-instantly modulating microbiota composition and function, an nLNP-based drug-delivery platform might be a powerful tool for treating ulcerative colitis. © 2021 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Yaks (Bos grunniens) live primarily in high-altitude hypoxic conditions and have a unique intestinal micro-ecosystem, remarkable adaptability, and strong climatic resistance. Accumulating evidence revealed the importance of probiotics in host metabolism, gut microbiota, growth performance, and health. The goal of this study was to screen out probiotics with excellent probiotic potential for clinical application. In this study, four strains of Bacillus, i.e., Bacillus proteolyticus (named Z1 and Z2), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (named J), and Bacillus subtilis (named K), were isolated and identified. Afterward, their probiotic potential was evaluated. Antioxidant activity tests revealed that Z1 had the highest DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, whereas Z2 had higher reducing power and inhibited lipid peroxidation. Additionally, the antibacterial testing revealed that all strains were antagonistic to three indicator pathogens, Escherichia coli C83902, Staphylococcus aureus BNCC186335, and Salmonella enteritidis NTNC13349. These isolates also had a higher hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, and acid and bile tolerance, all of which helped to survive and keep dangerous bacteria out of the host intestine. Importantly, all strains could be considered safe in terms of antibiotic susceptibility and lack of hemolysis. In conclusion, this is the first study to show that B. proteolyticus and B. amyloliquefaciens isolated from yaks have probiotic potential, providing a better foundation for future clinical use. © Copyright © 2021 Zeng, He, Li, Zhang, Huang, Wang, Li, Bao, Iqbal, Fakhar-e-Alam Kulyar and Li.</field>

		<field name="AB">A new formulation, nanoprebiotics [e.g., phthalyl pullulan nanoparticles (PPNs)], was demonstrated to enhance the antimicrobial activity of probiotics [e.g., Lactobacillus plantarum (LP)] in vitro through intracellular stimulation better than that by backbone prebiotics, which are commonly used. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether this combination would exert distinct effects as synbiotics in vivo. Synbiotics combinations of LP, pullulan, and PPNs were used as experimental treatments in a dysbiosis-induced murine model, and their restorative effect was assessed using pathogen Escherichia coli K99 challenge. Our results showed that the E. coli infection was suppressed markedly in the experimental group fed with synbiotics containing PPNs. In addition, the decrease in serum endotoxin level after synbiotics treatment suggested the reinforcement of the gut barrier. Comparison of treatment groups, including a normal control group, showed that synbiotics containing PPNs increased microbial diversity, which is a representative parameter of healthy status. Furthermore, distinct from probiotics treatment alone, synbiotics showed additive effects of enrichment of several well-known beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and other butyrate-producing bacteria including Faecalibacterium. Collectively, our results indicate that synbiotics containing PPNs are effective at restoring gut dysbiosis, suppressing pathogenic infection, and increasing microbial diversity, suggesting that synbiotics with nanoprebiotics have the potential to be a novel strategy for ameliorating gut dysbiosis and infectious diseases. © Copyright © 2021 Hong, Lee, Kim, Choi, Oh, Li, Choi, Chung, Jung, Kang and Cho.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background: An increasing number of studies have shown that natural products have anti-tumor effects, and it has become a hotspot in cancer research. However, few bibliometric analyses have been examined in this field systematically. The current study aimed to explore the status and provide the developing trends in the natural products on cancer research. Methods: Publications on natural products in cancer research were extracted from the Web of Science core collection database. CiteSpace (5.6.R3) software and GraphPad prism 6 were used to analyze and plot the references. Results: On February 1, 2021, 34,611 records of natural products in cancer research published from 2008 to 2020 were collected. The United States was the driving force, with a strong academic reputation in this area. The top-contributing institution was the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Most publications were published in Molecules. Efferth Thomas was the most prolific author, while Newman DJ was the most cited and frequently co-cited author. Flavonoid, curcumin, and polyphenol were the most widely studied natural products. Oleanolic acid and rosmarinic acid have gradually become research hotspots recently. Breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer were the most common types of cancer in this field. “Natural killer cell” was the leading research hotspot. The keywords of “leaf extract,” “molecular docking” and “gold nanoparticle” appeared most recently as research frontiers. Conclusion: Our results provided a general overview of the major research directions of natural products research in cancer. The mechanisms of natural products, especially those related to molecular docking, gold nanoparticle, gut microbiota, and immune checkpoints may soon become hotspots and should be closely monitored. © Copyright © 2021 Chen, Li, Zhang, Yao and Guo.</field>

		<field name="AB">Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) seriously affects children’s health, and the gut microbiome has been widely hypothesized to play a role in the regulation of ADHD behavior. The present study aims to the biosynthesize of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) by using Acinetobacter johnsonii strain RTN1, followed by their characterization through state-of-the-art material characterization techniques, viz., UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission and scanning electron microscopic analyses with energy dispersive spectrometry. Moreover, we investigated and compared the population composition of gut microbiota and their susceptibility to biogenic ZnONPs between healthy and ADHD children based on the traditional plate method and 16S rRNA amplicon sequence analysis. The antibacterial effect of ZnONPs against gut bacteria was also determined by measurement of live cell number, living/dead bacterial staining test, and flow cytometry observation. The present study revealed that the number of live gut bacteria in healthy children was more than 10-fold higher than that in ADHD children; however, the community structure of gut bacteria has changed, while greater diversity was found in gut bacteria from ADHD children. In addition, we found that the number of live gut bacteria in healthy and ADHD children was reduced by ZnONPs, which shows an increased and reduced effect in composition of gut bacteria from healthy and ADHD children, respectively. It was also noted that the main mechanism of ZnONPs may be to inhibit the growth of gut bacteria rather than to kill them, while the nanoparticle-resistant strains in healthy children is also different from that in ADHD children. Some representative bacteria, in particular nanoparticle-resistant bacteria, were successfully isolated and identified. Overall, this study revealed the potential correlation of ADHD with gut bacteria and provided a new possibility to prevent ADHD by the combination of nanoparticle and its resistant bacteria. © Copyright © 2021 Zhou, Yu, Ahmed, Jiang, Zhang, Lv, Alhumaydhi, Allemailem and Li.</field>

		<field name="AB">Minimizing the clinical signs of Enterococcus cecorum infections causing enterococcal spondylitis in broiler herds is successful when initiated as metaphylaxis in the first week of life. Mechanistically, either the Enterococcus species present at that time are reduced by antibiotic treatment or antibiotic treatment might induce changes in intestinal microbiota composition with an indirect and subsequent influence. The aim of the present study was to examine the cecal microbiota of chickens after administering lincospectin or different additives to evaluate whether these additives have lincospectin-like effects on microbiota. Therefore, 157,400 broiler chickens were reared in four chicken houses (~40,000 birds each) on a broiler farm with history of enterococcal spondylitis. Each flock was treated either with lincospectin or water soluble esterified butyrins, Bacillus (B.) licheniformis or palm oil was added via drinking water during the first days of life. Ten birds per house were dissected at days 11, 20 and 33 of life and cecal microbiota were analyzed (16S rRNA gene sequencing). Lincospectin treatment elicited significant changes in the cecal microbiota composition until slaughter age. Among the tested additives, effects of B. licheniformis on cecal microbiota composition were most similar to those seen after the treatment with lincospectin at day 11. © 2021 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">The EFSA has updated the Guidance on risk assessment of the application of nanoscience and nanotechnologies in the food and feed chain, human and animal health. It covers the application areas within EFSA’s remit, including novel foods, food contact materials, food/feed additives and pesticides. The updated guidance, now Scientific Committee Guidance on nano risk assessment (SC Guidance on Nano-RA), has taken account of relevant scientific studies that provide insights to physico-chemical properties, exposure assessment and hazard characterisation of nanomaterials and areas of applicability. Together with the accompanying Guidance on Technical requirements for regulated food and feed product applications to establish the presence of small particles including nanoparticles (Guidance on Particle-TR), the SC Guidance on Nano-RA specifically elaborates on physico-chemical characterisation, key parameters that should be measured, methods and techniques that can be used for characterisation of nanomaterials and their determination in complex matrices. The SC Guidance on Nano-RA also details aspects relating to exposure assessment and hazard identification and characterisation. In particular, nanospecific considerations relating to in vitro/in vivo toxicological studies are discussed and a tiered framework for toxicological testing is outlined. Furthermore, in vitro degradation, toxicokinetics, genotoxicity, local and systemic toxicity as well as general issues relating to testing of nanomaterials are described. Depending on the initial tier results, additional studies may be needed to investigate reproductive and developmental toxicity, chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity and allergenicity, neurotoxicity, effects on gut microbiome and endocrine activity. The possible use of read-across to fill data gaps as well as the potential use of integrated testing strategies and the knowledge of modes or mechanisms of action are also discussed.

		<field name="AB">Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of disabling, destructive and incurable immune-mediated inflammatory diseases comprising Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), disorders that are highly prevalent worldwide and demand a large investment in healthcare. A persistent inflammatory state enables the dysfunction and destruction of healthy tissue, hindering the initiation and endurance of wound healing. Current treatments are ineffective at counteracting disease progression. Further, increased risk of serious side effects, other comorbidities and/or opportunistic infections highlight the need for effective treatment options. Gut microbiota, the key to preserving a healthy state, may, alternatively, increase a patient’s susceptibility to IBD onset and development given a relevant bacterial dysbiosis. Hence, the main goal of this review is to showcase the main conventional and emerging therapies for IBD, including microbiota-inspired untargeted and targeted approaches (such as phage therapy) to infection control. Special recognition is given to existing targeted strategies with biologics (via monoclonal antibodies, small molecules and nucleic acids) and stimuli-responsive (pH-, enzyme-and reactive oxygen species-triggered release), polymer-based nanomedicine that is specifically directed towards the regulation of inflammation overload (with some nanosystems additionally functionalized with carbohydrates or peptides directed towards M1-macrophages). The overall goal is to restore gut balance and decrease IBD’s societal impact. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</field>

		<field name="AB">Plant-derived nanoparticles (PDNPs) are naturally occurring exosome-like nanovesicles derived from dietary plants containing key plant bioactives. Ginger-derived PDNPs have a therapeutic effect on alcohol-induced liver injury, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer. PDNPs are conventionally purified by differential ultracentrifugation, a technique not amenable for scale up. We have recently developed a polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000-based method for cost-effective purification of ginger PDNPs, with comparable efficiency to differential ultracentrifugation (Sci. Rep. 2020, 10 (1), 4456.). Herein, we report a 4-5-fold higher ginger PDNP recovery when PEG precipitation was carried out in low pH conditions (pH 4 and 5). Low pH-derived ginger PDNPs were smaller in size without an overt change in zeta potential. The spontaneous intracellular entry and protection against oxidative stress in A431 cells were similar between ginger PDNPs purified under low, neutral, and alkaline pH. Low-pH purified ginger PDNPs had higher levels of total polyphenolic content compared to PDNPs purified under neutral and alkaline pH. Recently, ginger PDNP-derived microRNAs have been shown to exhibit cross-kingdom regulation by targeting human, gut microbiome, and viral transcripts. Using qRT-PCR, we also verified the presence of miRNAs that were predicted to target SARS-CoV-2 in ginger PDNPs purified under low pH. Thus, we have developed a method to purify ginger PDNPs in high yields by using low-pH conditions without affecting the major bioactive contents of PDNPs. © 2021 The Authors.

		<field name="AB">Diet and bile play critical roles in shaping gut microbiota, but the molecular mechanism underlying interplay with intestinal microbiota is unclear. Here, we showed that lemon-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (LELNs) enhance lactobacilli toleration to bile. To decipher the mechanism, we used Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) as proof of concept to show that LELNs enhance LGG bile resistance via limiting production of Msp1 and Msp3, resulting in decrease of bile accessibility to cell membrane. Furthermore, we found that decline of Msps protein levels was regulated through specific tRNAserUCC and tRNAserUCG decay. We identified RNase P, an essential housekeeping endonuclease, being responsible for LELNs-induced tRNAserUCC and tRNAserUCG decay. We further identified galacturonic acid-enriched pectin-type polysaccharide as the active factor in LELNs to increase bile resistance and downregulate tRNAserUCC and tRNAserUCG level in the LGG. Our study demonstrates a tRNA-based gene expression regulation mechanism among lactobacilli to increase bile resistance. © 2021</field>

		<field name="AB">Restrictions on the use of antibiotics in the poultry industry stimulate the development of alternative nutritional solutions to maintain or improve poultry health. This requires more insight in the modulatory effects of feed additives on the immune system and microbiota composition. Compounds known to influence the innate immune system and microbiota composition were selected and screened in vitro, in ovo, and in vivo. Among all compounds, 57 enhanced NK cell activation, 56 increased phagocytosis, and 22 increased NO production of the macrophage cell line HD11 in vitro. Based on these results, availability and regulatory status, six compounds were selected for further analysis. None of these compounds showed negative effects on growth, hatchability, and feed conversion in in ovo and in vivo studies. Based on the most interesting numerical results and highest future potential feasibility, two compounds were analyzed further. Administration of glucose oligosaccharide and long-chain glucomannan in vivo both enhanced activation of intraepithelial NK cells and led to increased relative abundance of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) amongst ileum and ceca microbiota after seven days of supplementation. Positive correlations between NK cell subsets and activation, and relative abundance of LAB suggest the involvement of microbiota in the modulation of the function of intraepithelial NK cells. This study identifies glucose oligosaccharide and longchain glucomannan supplementation as effective nutritional strategies to modulate the intestinal microbiota composition and strengthen the intraepithelial innate immune system. © 2021 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Tributyrin and essential oils have been used as alternatives to antimicrobials to improve gut health and growth performance in piglets. This study was to evaluate the effects of a dietary supplement with two encapsulated products containing different combinations of tributyrin with oregano or with methyl salicylate on growth performance, serum biochemical parameters related to the physiological status, intestinal microbiota and metabolites of piglets. A total of 108 weaned crossbred piglets (Yorkshire × Landrace, 21 ± 1 d, 8.21 ± 0.04 kg) were randomly divided into three groups. Piglets were fed with one of the following diets for 5 weeks: a basal diet as the control (CON); the control diet supplemented with an encapsulated mixture containing 30% of methyl sa-licylate and tributyrin at a dosage of 3 kg/t (CMT); and the control diet supplemented with an encapsulated mixture containing 30% of oregano oil and tributyrin at a dosage of 3 kg/t (COT). At the end of the feeding trial, six piglets from each group were slaughtered to collect blood and gut samples for physiological status and gut microbiological analysis. The study found that the CMT group was larger in feed intake (FI) (p &lt; 0.05), average daily gain (ADG) (p = 0.09), total protein (TP), albu-min (ALB), glutathione peroxidase (GSH‐PX) (p &lt; 0.05), blood total antioxidant capacity (T‐AOC) (p &lt; 0.05), and crypt depth in the ileum (p &lt; 0.05) compared with the CON group. The genus abundance of Tissierella and Campylobacter in the CMT group was significantly decreased compared with the CON group. The CMT group also resulted in significantly higher activity in amino acid metabolism and arginine biosynthesis compared with the CON group. The COT group was larger in T‐AOC, and the genus abundance of Streptophyta and Chlamydia was significantly increased in the ileum compared with the CON group. Data analysis found a significantly high correlation between the genus abundance of Chlamydia and that of Campylobacter in the ileum. The genus abundance of Cam-pylobacter was also positively correlated with the sorbitol level. In general, the results indicated that the supplementation of both encapsulated mixtures in diet of weaned piglets could improve the animal blood antioxidant capacity. Additionally, the encapsulated mixture of methyl salicylate plus tributyrin improved the growth performance and resulted in certain corresponding changes in nutrient metabolism and in the genus abundance of ileum microbial community. © 2021 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">D-cysteine (D-cys) has been demonstrated to possess an extraordinary antibacterial activity because of its unique steric configuration. However, inefficient antibacterial properties seriously hinder its wide applications. Here, cysteine-functionalized gold nanoparticles (D-/L-Au NPs) were prepared by loading D-/L-cysteine on the surface of gold nanoparticles for the effective inhibition of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in vitro and in vivo, and the effects on the intestinal microflora in mice were explored during the treatment of E. coli infection in the gut. We found that the antibacterial activity of D-/L-Au NPs was more than 2–3 times higher than pure D-cysteine, L-cysteine and Au NPs. Compared with L-Au NPs, D-Au NPs showed the stronger antibacterial activity, which was related to its unique steric configuration. Chiral Au NPs showed stronger destructive effects on cell membrane compared to other groups, which further leads to the leakage of the cytoplasm and bacterial cell death. The in vivo antibacterial experiment illustrated that D-Au NPs displayed impressive antibacterial activity in the treatment of E. coli-infected mice comparable to kanamycin, whereas they could not affect the balance of intestinal microflora. This work is of great significance in the development of an effective chiral antibacterial agent. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

		<field name="AB">The use of various aspects of food processing, including the direct inclusion of nano-additives, are rapidly increasing in the field of nanotechnology to enhance the desired qualities in food production, use and storage. The important role of the human gut microbiota is well understood, including its influence on many physiological functions and its alterations, which play an essential role in various human diseases. Research exploring the effect of engineered and naturally occurring nanoparticles (NPs) in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of humans on commensal and pathogenic microorganisms is lacking and scarce. Studies should focus on the complex human gut microbiome when investigating the influence of NPs within a human body. Various materials, such as titanium dioxide, silver, silicon dioxide, iron dioxide and zinc oxide, show great potential in affecting the microbiota and causing clinical disorders including colitis, obesity, and immunological dysfunction. This review reports the influence of such nano- food additives towards the gut microbiota (GM), as well as methods to track and monitor the NPsin vivousing techniques such as electron microscopy after interaction with NPs andin vitrogut models currently used to examine the influence of NPs with GM, as well as their limitations. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.</field>

		<field name="AB">Xylan oligosaccharides (XOS) can promote proliferation of Pediococcus acidilactic BCC-1, which benefits gut health and growth performance of broilers. The study aimed to investigate the effect of Pediococcus acidilactic BCC-1 (referred to BBC) and XOS on the gut metabolome and microbiota of broilers. The feed conversion ratio of BBC group, XOS group and combined XOS and BBC groups was lower than the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Combined XOS and BBC supplementation (MIX group) elevated butyrate content of the cecum (P &lt; 0.05) and improved ileum morphology by enhancing the ratio of the villus to crypt depth (P &lt; 0.05). The 16S rDNA results indicated that both XOS and BBC induced high abundance of butyric acid bacteria. XOS treatment elevated Clostridium XIVa and the BBC group enriched Anaerotruncus and Faecalibacterium. In contrast, MIX group induced higher relative abundance of Clostridiaceae XIVa, Clostridiaceae XIVb and Lachnospiraceae. Besides, MIX group showed lower abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter. Metabolome analysis showed that all the 3 treatment groups (XOS, BBC and MIX) showed lower concentrations of sorbitol and both XOS and BBC group had higher concentrations of pyridoxine levels than CT group. Besides, XOS and BBC groups enhanced the content of hydroxyphenyl derivatives 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate 1 and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Notably, MIX group enhanced both 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate 1 and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (P &lt; 0.05). Thus, XOS and BBC may have a synergistic role to improve the performance of broilers by modulating gut microbiota and metabolome. © Copyright © 2021 Wu, Lei, Wang, Yin, Aggrey, Guo and Yuan.</field>

		<field name="AB">Excessive use of antibiotics has detrimental consequences, including antibiotic resistance and gut microbiome destruction. Probiotic-rich diets help to restore good microbes, keeping the body healthy and preventing the onset of chronic diseases. Honey contains not only prebiotic oligosaccharides but, like yogurt and fermented foods, is an innovative natural source for probiotic discovery. Here, a collection of three honeybee samples was screened for yeast strains, aiming to char-acterize their potential in vitro probiotic properties and the ability to produce valuable metabolites. Ninety-four isolates out of one-hundred and four were able to grow at temperatures of 30◦ C and 37◦ C, while twelve isolates could grow at 42◦ C. Fifty-eight and four isolates displayed the ability to grow under stimulated gastrointestinal condition, at pH 2.0–2.5, 0.3% (w/v) bile salt, and 37◦ C. Twenty-four isolates showed high autoaggregation of 80–100% and could utilize various sugars, including galactose and xylose. The cell count of these isolates (7–9 log cfu/mL) was recorded and stable during 6 months of storage. Genomic characterization based on the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) also identified four isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae displayed good ability to produce antimicrobial acids. These results provided the basis for selecting four natural yeast isolates as starter cultures for potential probiotic application in functional foods and animal feed. Additionally, these S. cerevisiae isolates also produced high levels of acids from fermented sugarcane molasses, an abundant agricultural waste product from the sugar industry. Furthermore, one of ten identified isolates of Meyerozyma guilliermondiii displayed an excellent ability to produce a pentose sugar xylitol at a yield of 0.490 g/g of consumed xylose. Potentially, yeast isolates of honeybee samples may offer various biotechnological advantages as probiotics or metabolite producers of multiproduct-based lignocellulosic biorefinery. © 2021 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">The application of nanoparticles (NPs) for food safety is increasingly being explored. Zinc oxide (ZnO) and silver (Ag) NPs are inorganic chemicals with antimicrobial and bioactive characteristics and have been widely used in the food industry. However, not much is known about the behavior of these NPs upon ingestion and whether they inhibit natural gut microflora. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of ZnO and Ag NPs on the intestinal bacteria, namely Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium animalis. Cells were inoculated into tryptic soy broth or Lactobacilli MRS broth containing 1% of NP-free solution, 0, 12, 16, 20 mM of ZnO NPs or 0, 1.8, 2.7, 4.6 mM Ag NPs, and incubated at 37◦C for 24 h. The presence and characterization of the NPs on bacterial cells were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Membrane leakage and cell viability were assessed using a UV-visible spectrophotometer and confocal electron microscope, respectively. Numbers of treated cells were within 1 log CFU/mL less than those of the controls for up to 12 h of incubation. Cellular morphological changes were observed, but many cells remained in normal shapes. Only a small amount of internal cellular contents was leaked due to the NP treatments, and more live than dead cells were observed after exposure to the NPs. Based on these results, we conclude that ZnO and Ag NPs have mild inhibitory effects on intestinal bacteria. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</field>

		<field name="AB">Onions are the main dietary source of flavonols that have been associated with important health-promoting properties. Onion treated by high-pressure processing (HPP-treated onion) was subjected to a dynamic gastrointestinal digestion and colon fermentation simulator (DGID-CF) to study the effect on the gut microbiota metabolism in the three colon regions (ascending—AC, transverse—TC, and descending—DC) by means of chronic feeding with 27 g/day for 14 days. HPP-treated onion presented a high content of the flavonols quercetin-3,4’-diglucoside and quercetin-4’-glucoside, and a large percentage of them reached the AC without change. TC and DC progressively increased the total phenolic metabolites 2.5 times respective to day 2, mainly 3-hydroxyphenylacetic, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acids. In addition, the chronic feeding increased the beneficial colon bacteria Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. and the production of total SCFAs (acetic, propionic, and butyric acids) 9 times (AC), 2.2 times (TC), and 4.4 times (DC) respective to day 1. A multivariate analysis (principal component analysis, PCA) showed a clear separation between the three colon regions based on their phenolic composition (precursors and metabolites). These results showed that HPP-treated onion modulated the human gut microbiota’s metabolism and the DGID-CF is a good system to study these changes. © 2021 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Monosodium glutamate (MSG)-induced abdominal obesity, conventionally caused by hypothalamic damage, is a critical risk factor for health problem. Microbiota-gut-brain axis plays important roles in a variety of metabolic diseases. However, whether gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis for MSG-induced abdominal obesity and the effect of quercetin on it remains unclear. Herein, we find that MSG-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to neuronal damage in the hypothalamus, as indicated by antibiotics-induced microbiota depletion and co-house treatment. Inspired by this finding, we investigate the mechanism in-depth for MSG-induced abdominal obesity. Liver transcriptome profiling shows retinol metabolism disorder in MSG-induced abdominal obese mice. In which, retinol saturase (RetSat) in the liver is notably up-regulated, and the downstream lipogenesis is correspondingly elevated. Importantly, microbiota depletion or co-house treatment eliminates the difference of RetSat expression in the liver, indicating gut microbiota changes are responsible for liver retinol metabolism disorder. Moreover, this study finds dietary quercetin could modulate MSG-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, alleviate hypothalamic damage and down-regulate liver RetSat expression, thus ameliorating abdominal obesity. Our study enriches the pathogenesis of MSG-induced abdominal obesity and provides a prebiotic agent to ameliorate abdominal obesity. © Copyright © 2021 Zhao, Zhu, Xia, Li, Guo, Zhu and Yang.</field>

		<field name="AB">A Gram-positive, coccobacillus, white raised and circular with an entire edge colony, and obligately anaerobic bacterium, strain SW178 was isolated from the cecum content of feral chickens in Brookings, South Dakota, USA. The most closely related strain based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of strain SW178 was Mediterraneibacter torques ATCC 27756T (Ruminococcus torques ATCC 27756T) with 96.94% similarity. The genome of strain SW178 is 3.18 Mbp with G+C content of 46.9 mol%. The optimal temperature and pH for growth in modified brain heart infusion (BHI-M) medium were 45 C and pH 7.5, respectively. The sole carbon sources of the strain were dextrin, L-fucose, D-galacturonic, a-D-glucose, L-rhamnose and D-sorbitol. The primary cellular fatty acids were C14 : 0, C16 : 0 and C16 : 0 dimethyl acetal (DMA). Based on the genotypic and phenotypic comparison, we proposed that strain SW178 belong to the genus Mediterraneibacter in the family Lachnospiraceae as a novel species, in which the name Mediterraneibacter catenae is proposed.

		<field name="AB">Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a refractory disorder characterized by chronic and recurrent inflammation. The progression and pathogenesis of IBD is closely related to oxidative stress and irregularly high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A new oxidation-responsive nano prodrug was constructed from a phenylboronic esters-modified carboxylmethyl chitosan (OC-B) conjugated with berberine (BBR) that degrades selectively in response to ROS. The optimized micelles exhibited well-controlled physiochemical properties and stability in a physiological environment. OC-B-BBR micelles could effectively encapsulate the anti-inflammatory drug berberine and exhibit ideal H2O2-triggered release behavior as confirmed by in vitro drug loading and release studies. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effect and regulation of gut microbiota caused by it were explored in mice with colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). The results showed that OC-B-BBR significantly ameliorated colitis symptoms and colon damage by regulating the expression levels of IL-6 and remodeling gut microbiota. In summary, this study exhibited a novel BBR-loaded Carboxylmethyl Chitosan nano delivery system which may represent a promising approach for improving IBD treatment. © Copyright © 2021 Zhao, Du, Tian, Kang, Li, Dai, Li, Zhang and Li.</field>

		<field name="AB">The in vitro development of representative gut microbiota from obese individuals has been approached in the present study by using a three-stage dynamic simulator of the human gut microbiota (BFBL Gut Model). During the stabilization period, aimed to reach the microbiota steady state, initial differences found between normal-weight (Nw) and obese (Ob) faecal samples were reproduced. The differentiation included lower values of Akkermansia, Enterococcus and Faecalibacterium and higher values of Lactobacillus for the Ob microbiota when compared with the Nw microbiota. The change of food ingredients to simulate a high consumption of readily-fermented carbohydrates and fructose-enriched beverages maintained these differences and additionally produced a decrease of Bifidobacterium in the Ob microbiota. Related to obesity metabolic signatures, a lower capacity to produce propionate was characteristic of the Ob microbiota under all the tested conditions. This could be useful in the selection of food ingredients for targeted production of propionate by the human gut microbiota prior to their assessment in nutritional intervention studies related to obesity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd</field>

		<field name="AB">Early life events can lead to multiple diseases in adulthood. Previous studies suggested that polysorbate 80 (P80) as a widely used emulsifier in pharmaceutical formulations and food industries could impair the intestinal barrier. However, whether maternal P80 (MP80) exposure could affect the long-term health of offspring remains unknown. In this study, we found that maternal P80 intake could retard intestinal development, disrupt the intestinal barrier, and cause lowgrade intestinal inflammation in 3-week-old offspring. 16S rRNA sequencing and correlation analysis revealed that Mucispirillum, Clostridium XI, and Parabacteroides, which positively correlated with intestinal proliferation and differentiation, were decreased in the maternal P80 group. Interestingly, the increase in some harmful bacteria, including Proteobacteria, Helicobacteraceae, Campylobacterales, and Desulfovibrionales, persisted from the weaning period to adulthood (3 to 8weeks). Furthermore, a fecal microbiota transplantation assay showed that the mice gavaged with feces from 3-week-old offspring of the MP80 group presented more severe intestinal inflammation and barrier disruption than the mice that received feces from the offspring of the control group. Finally, maternal P80 intake remarkably aggravated the structural disorder of intestinal crypt, increased proinflammatory factors, and exacerbated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in adulthood. Conclusively, maternal P80 intake could induce gut dysbiosis and promote colitis susceptibility in adulthood.

		<field name="AB">Gut microbiomes play an essential role in host survival and local adaptation and thus can facilitate the invasion of host species. Biological invasions have been shown to be linked to the genetic properties of alien host species. It is thus plausible that the holobiont, the host, and its associated microbiome act as an entity to drive invasion success. The bighead carp and silver carp (bigheaded carps), invasive species that exhibit extensive hybridization in the Mississippi River Basin (MRB), provided a unique model to test the holobiont hypothesis of invasion. Here, we investigated the microbiomes of foreguts and hindguts in bigheaded carps and their reciprocal hybrids reared in aquaculture ponds using 16S amplicons and the associated gene prediction. We found an admixed pattern in the gut microbiome community in bigheaded carp hybrids. The hybrid gut microbiomes showed special characteristics such as relatively high alpha diversity in the foregut, an increasing dissimilarity between foreguts and hindguts, and a remarkable proportion of genes coding for putative enzymes related to their digestion of main food resources (Cyanobacteria, cellulose, and chitin). The pond-reared hybrids had advantageous features in genes coding for putative enzymes related to their diet. The above results collectively suggested that the gut microbiomes of hybrids could be beneficial to their local adaptation (e.g., food resource utilization), which might have facilitated their invasion in the MRB. The gut microbial findings, along with the intrinsic genomic features likely associated with life-history traits revealed in our recent study, provide preliminary evidence supporting the holobiont hypothesis of invasion. © 2020 The Authors.

		<field name="AB">Ginger, a widely used functional food and food additive, little is known about the effect of ginger juice, which is rich in many healthful agents, on healthy humans or on its relationship with gut microbiota composition variation. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in the gut microbial communities that occur following the supplementation of fresh ginger-derived juice in healthy adults and its potential associations with function. A crossover intervention study in which 123 healthy subjects (63 men and 60 women) consumed fresh ginger juice from Zingiber officinale Rosc. or sterile 0.9% sodium chloride was conducted. 16S rRNA sequencing analyses were applied to characterize gut microbiota variation. We found that ginger juice intervention increased the species number of intestinal flora. A decreased relative abundance of the Prevotella-to-Bacteroides ratio and pro-inflammatory Ruminococcus_1 and Ruminococcus_2 while a tendency toward an increased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, Proteobacteria and anti-inflammatory Faecalibacterium were found. When we did not consider gender, we found differences in bacterial diversity both in community evenness and in richness caused by ginger intervention. In fact, there were different changes in bacterial α-diversity induced by the ginger juice in men and women. We identified 19 bacterial genera with significant differences between the control group (women) and ginger group (women) and 15 significant differences between the control group (men) and ginger group (men) at the genus level. Our results showed that short-term intake of ginger juice had substantial effects on the composition and function of gut microbiota in healthy people. Moreover, our findings underscored the importance of analyzing both male and female individuals to investigate the effects of ginger on gut microbiota. Additional studies are necessary to confirm these findings. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Zhang, Jiang, Zhang, Pang, Gao, Zhang, Zhang, Xiao, Chen, Wang, Qi and Li.</field>

		<field name="AB">A stable intestinal microflora is an essential prerequisite for human health. This study investigated the interaction between Escherichia coli exopolysaccharides (named EPS-m2) and the human gut microbiota (HGM) in vitro. The EPS-m2 was produced by E. coli WM3064 when treated with ceftriaxone. The monosaccharide composition analysis revealed that EPS-m2 is composed of glucuronic acid, glucose, fucose, galactose/N-acetyl glucosamine, arabinose, xylose, and ribose with a molar ratio of approximately 77:44:29:28:2:1:1. The carbohydrates, protein, and uronic acids contents in EPS-m2 was 78.6 ± 0.1%, 4.38 ± 0.11%, and 3.86 ± 0.09%, respectively. In vitro batch fermentation experiments showed that 77% of EPS-m2 could be degraded by human fecal microbiota after 72 h of fermentation. In reverse, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis showed that EPS-m2 increased the abundance of Alistipes, Acinetobacter, Alloprevotella, Howardella, and Oxalobacter; GC detection illustrated that EPS-m2 enhanced the production of SCFAs. These findings indicated that EPS-m2 supplementation could regulate the HGM and might facilitate modulation of human health. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Chen, Cao, Hu, Chen and Yin.</field>

		<field name="AB">Our previous study showed that emodin enema modulates gut microbiota and delays CKD progression. However, the poor solubility, limited colonic irrigation retention time, and inadequate colon adhesion of emodin hinder its clinical application. Based on the deficiencies of emodin, we prepared monomethoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-poly (lactic acid)-chitosan-2-mercaptobenzimidazole nanoparticles with incorporated emodin (emodin-NP) and studied their efficacy in delaying CKD progression. 5/6 nephrectomized Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered via colonic irrigation with emodin-NP every two days for eight weeks. We found that treatment with emodin-NP improved the kidney function of the rats and limited the expansion of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Treatment with emodin-NP once every two days is comparable to emodin treatment once a day. Furthermore, emodin-NP via colonic irrigation remarkably reduced IL-1β, IL-6, and LPS levels in serum, improved intestinal barrier functions, and downregulated the key proteins (TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB) expression in intestinal TLR4 signaling pathway. 16S rDNA analyses showed that emodin-NP can regulate microbiota disturbance in CKD. Taken together, these results suggest that emodin-NP alleviates kidney dysfunction and tubulointerstitial fibrosis by mediation through the modification of gut microbiota disorders. Emodin-NP may be a new method to treat CKD. © Copyright © 2021 Lu, Ji, Luo, Lan, Han, Chen, Liu, Lin, Lu, Wu Guo and Zou.</field>

		<field name="AB">Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract due, at least partially, to an aberrant and excessive mucosalimmune response to gut bacteria in genetically-predisposed individuals undercertain environmental factors. The incidence of IBD is rising in western and newlyindustrialized countries, paralleling the increase of westernized dietary patterns,through new antigens, epithelial function and permeability, epigenetic mechanisms(e.g., DNA methylation), and alteration of the gut microbiome.Alteration in the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome (includingbacteria, viruses and fungi) seems to be a nuclear pathogenic factor. Themicrobiome itself is dynamic, and the changes in food quality, dietary habits,living conditions and hygiene of these western societies, could interact in acomplex manner as modulators of dysbiosis, thereby influencing the activation ofimmune cells’ promoting inflammation. The microbiome produces diverse smallmolecules via several metabolic ways, with the fiber-derived short-chain fattyacids (i.e., butyrate) as main elements and having anti-inflammatory effects. Thesemetabolites and some micronutrients of the diet (i.e., vitamins, folic acid, betacarotene and trace elements) are regulators of innate and adaptive intestinalimmune homeostasis. An excessive and unhealthy consumption of sugar, animalfat and a low-vegetable and -fiber diet are risk factors for IBD appearance. Furthermore,metabolism of nutrients in intestinal epithelium and in gut microbiotais altered by inflammation, changing the demand for nutrients needed forhomeostasis. This role of food and a reduced gut microbial diversity in causingIBD might also have a prophylactic or therapeutic role for IBD. The relationship between dietary intake, symptoms, and bowel inflammation could lead to dietaryand lifestyle recommendations, including diets with abundant fruits, vegetables,olive oil and oily fish, which have anti-inflammatory effects and could preventdysbiosis and IBD. Dietary modulation and appropriate exclusion diets might be anew complementary management for treatment at disease flares and in refractorypatients, even reducing complications, hospitalizations and surgery, throughmodifying the luminal intestinal environment © The Author(s) 2021.

		<field name="AB">In this study, in vitro digestion and fermentation was employed to simulate the consumption of fermented okara and hence, evaluate its potential as a functional food ingredient. This is to develop a method of utilizing okara without producing secondary waste. Fermentation increased the amount of soluble dietary fiber by 187%. Bioaccessibility of amino acids, fatty acids, and vitamin K2 MK-7 is higher in the digestion supernatant of fermented okara. Bacillus subtilis also remained viable after digestion. Supernatants of fermented okara exhibited higher bio accessibility of total phenolic content and higher DPPH radical scavenging activity in the small and large intestines. Similarly, the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid were 44.4%, 46.9%, and 51.8% higher, respectively. The gut microbiota was also found to be different in the fermentation supernatants between fermented and unfermented okara.

		<field name="AB">Noncaloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) are extensively introduced into commonly consumed drinks and foods worldwide. However, data on the health effects of NAS consumption remain elusive. Saccharin and sucralose have been shown to pass through the human gastrointestinal tract without undergoing absorption and metabolism and directly encounter the gut microbiota community. Here, we aimed to identify a novel mechanism linking intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) to saccharin/sucralose-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in mice. Saccharin/sucralose consumption altered the gut microbial community structure, with significant depletion of A. muciniphila abundance in the cecal contents of mice, resulting in disruption of intestinal permeability and a high level of serum lipopolysaccharide, which likely contributed to systemic inflammation and caused NAFLD in mice. Saccharin/sucralose also markedly decreased microbiota-derived AHR ligands and colonic AHR expression, which are closely associated with many metabolic syndromes. Metformin or fructo-oligosaccharide supplementation significantly restored A. muciniphila and AHR ligands in sucralose-consuming mice, consequently ameliorating NAFLD. IMPORTANCE Our findings indicate that the gut-liver signaling axis contributes to saccharin/sucralose consumption-induced NAFLD. Supplementation with metformin or fructo-oligosaccharide is a potential therapeutic strategy for NAFLD treatment. In addition, we also developed a new nutritional strategy by using a natural sweetener (neohesperidin dihydrochalcone [NHDC]) as a substitute for NAS and free sugars. © 2021 Shi et al.

		<field name="AB">Anaerobes are a major constituent of the gut microbiome and profoundly influence the overall health of humans. However, the lack of a simple, cost-effective, and scalable system that mimics the anaerobic conditions of the human gut is hindering research on the gut microbiome and the development of therapeutics. Here, we address this gap by using glucose oxidase and catalase containing gelatin microparticles (GOx-CAT-GMPs) to precisely regulate dissolved oxygen concentration [O2] via GOx-mediated consumption of oxygen. Fluorescence images generated using conjugated polymer afterglow nanoparticles showed that [O2] can be tuned from 257.9 ​± ​6.2 to 0.0 ​± ​4.0 ​μM using GOx-CAT-GMPs. Moreover, when the obligate anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was inoculated in media containing GOx-CAT-GMPs, bacterial growth under ambient oxygen was comparable to control conditions in an anaerobic chamber (5.4 ​× ​105 and 8.8 ​× ​105 colony forming units mL−1, respectively). Finally, incorporating GOx-CAT-GMPs into a bioreactor that permitted continuous radial diffusion of oxygen and glucose generated a gut-mimetic [O2] gradient of 132.4 ​± ​2.6 ​μM in the outer ring of the reactor to 7.9 ​± ​1.7 ​μM at the core. Collectively, these results indicate that GOx-CAT-GMPs are highly effective oxygen-regulating materials. These materials can potentially be leveraged to advance gut microbiome research and fecal microbiota transplantation, particularly in low-resource settings. © 2020 The Author(s)</field>

		<field name="AB">Beneficial effects of probiotics and prebiotics are mainly related to modulation of compositions and activities of gut microbiota as well as manipulation of immunological reactivity in autoimmune diseases. In the present study, we examined whether metabolic products from different strains of Lactobacillus brevis cultured with different prebiotics have similar immunomodulating properties on immune cells under normal and inflammatory conditions, using mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Two strains of Lactobacillus brevis (3448 and 8429) were cultured with four different prebiotics, such as xylooligosaccharides, inulin, pectin, and chitosan. Sterile supernatants containing different metabolic products have been used for direct treatment of cell cultures prepared from CII-immunized mice and non-immunized (control mice). Our results showed that metabolic products from XOS decreased levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-α in both cultures from immunized and non-immunized mice. In contrast, metabolic products from inulin, pectin, and chitosan increased concentrations of these cytokines with highest values for pectin. Neither of investigated prebiotics influenced the secretion of IL-10. In addition, we found changes in the percentage of macrophages, which were different for the tested prebiotics. Also, metabolic products from pectin and chitosan caused loss of T-cells (CD3+) and increased percentages of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells and CD8+CD279+ anergic T cells. Hence, our data indicate that immunomodulating properties of probiotics are strain-specific and prebiotic-dependent. © 2020 Termedia Publishing House Ltd.. All rights reserved.</field>

		<field name="AB">Feed additives have been suggested to improve animal growth performance through modulating the gut microbiota. The hypothesis of this study was that the combination of two organic acids would exert synergistic effects on the growth performance and gut microbiota of weaning pigs. To test this hypothesis, we followed 398 weaning pigs from two university experiment stations (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and University of Arkansas (UA)) to determine the effects of increasing levels (0%, 0.035%, 0.070%, and 0.105%) of sodium butyrate combined with 0.5% benzoic acid on the growth performance of nursery pigs. At the UA, an additional negative control diet was included and the gut microbiota analysis was carried out. At both universities, increasing levels of sodium butyrate in a diet containing 0.5% benzoic acid improved growth perfor-mance, which reached a plateau in the pigs fed 0.035% (SBA0.035) or 0.070% (SBA0.070) butyrate. Gut microbiota analysis revealed that pigs fed the SBA0.035 diet had more diverse microbiota and contained more potentially beneficial bacteria such as Oscillospira, Blautia, and Turicibacter and reduced levels of Veillonella and Sarcina. Results of the present study indicated that the inclusion of sodium butyrate at moderate levels in a diet containing 0.5% benzoic acid improved growth performance of weaning pigs and established potential health benefits on gut microbiota. © 2021 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">The gut microbiome is not only an indicator of different pathologies, but it also influences metabolism and overall health of the host. Recently, microorganisms inherent to the gut microbiome, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Clostridium cochlearium, were demonstrated to be electroactive, i.e. to perform extracellular electron transfer (EET). To further explore the presence of electroactive microorganisms in the gut microbiome electrochemical enrichment starting from mouse feces was performed. Open circuit, abiotic and autoclaved inoculum controls were run in parallel. A maximum current density of 122±23 µA cm−2 at low coulombic efficiency ( ̴1%) was achieved. The presence of biofilms at the anode and microbial electrochemical activity with a formal potential of EET of 0.23±0.01 V vs. Ag/AgCl sat. KCl was demonstrated using fluorescence microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing and PCR-free Nanopore sequencing showed the enrichment and dominance of Shigella flexneri. © 2020</field>

		<field name="AB">This study was conducted to investigate the effect of dietary probiotics or synbiotics supplementation on colonic microbiota, antioxidant capacity, and immune function in weaned piglets. A total of 64 pregnant Bama mini-sows and then 128 of their weaned piglets were randomly assigned into control group, antibiotics group, probiotics group, or synbiotics group. The results showed that colonic Firmicutes and Bifidobacterium abundances in the probiotics group and total bacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Lactobacillus abundances in the synbiotics group were increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05), while Escherichia coli abundance in the synbiotics group was decreased (P = 0.061) compared with the control group. Firmicutes, Bifidobacterium, and total bacteria abundances were increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05) in the probiotics and synbiotics groups compared with the antibiotics group. Probiotics supplementation up-regulated (P &amp;lt; 0.05) the mRNA expression of GPR109A compared with the control and antibiotics groups. Dietary probiotics or synbiotics supplementation improved the antioxidant capacity by increasing (P &amp;lt; 0.05) the colonic CAT, GSH-Px, SOD, and T-AOC levels and plasma CAT, GSH, GSH-Px, and SOD levels and by decreasing (P &amp;lt; 0.05) the colonic and plasma MDA and H2O2 levels. Compared to the control group, the colonic IL-10, IFN-α, and sIgA concentrations and plasma IgA and IgM concentrations were significantly increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05) in the probiotics and synbiotics groups. Spearman's correlation analysis showed that the changed colonic microbiota, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were correlated with the alteration of antioxidant indexes, cytokines, and immunoglobulins. In conclusion, dietary probiotics or synbiotics supplementation during gestation, lactation, and nursery periods could be used as an alternative for antibiotics in terms of gut health of weaned piglets. © Copyright © 2020 Wang, Zhu, Kong, Song, Azad, Xiong, Zheng and He.</field>

		<field name="AB">Mango (Mangifera indica L.), a fruit with sensorial attractiveness and extraordinary nutritional and phytochemical composition, is one of the most consumed tropical varieties in the world. A growing body of evidence suggests that their bioactive composition differentiates them from other fruits, with mango pulp being an especially rich and diverse source of polyphenols. In this study, mango pulp polyphenols were submitted to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion and colonic fermentation, and aliquots were analyzed by HPLC-HRMS. The main phenolic compounds identified in the mango pulp were hydroxybenzoic acid-hexoside, two mono-galloyl-glucoside isomers and vanillic acid. The release of total polyphenols increased after the in vitro digestion, with an overall bioaccessibility of 206.3%. Specifically, the most bioaccessible mango polyphenols were gallic acid, 3-O-methylgallic acid, two hydroxybenzoic acid hexosides, methyl gallate, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and benzoic acid, which potentially cross the small intestine reaching the colon for fermentation by the resident microbiota. After 48 h of fecal fermentation, the main resultant mango catabolites were pyrogallol, gallic and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acids. This highlighted the extensive transformation of mango pulp polyphenols through the gastrointestinal tract and by the resident gut microbiota, with the resultant formation of mainly simple phenolics, which can be considered as biomarkers of the colonic metabolism of mango. © 2020 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have become common in the food industry, which motivates the need to evaluate ENM effects on human health. Gastrointestinal (GI) in vitro models (e.g. Caco-2, Caco-2/HT29-MTX) have been used in nanotoxicology research. However, the human gut environment is composed of both human cells and the gut microbiota. The goal of this study is to increase the complexity of the Caco-2/HT29-MTX in vitro model by co-culturing human cells with the Gram-positive, commensal Lactobacillus rhamnosus or the Gram-negative, opportunistic Escherichia coli; with the hypothesis that the presence of bacteria would ameliorate the effects of exposure to metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) such as iron oxide (Fe2O3), silicone dioxide (SiO2), titanium dioxide (TiO2), or zinc oxide (ZnO). To understand this relationship, Caco-2/HT29-MTX cell barriers were acutely co-exposed (4 hours) to bacteria and/or NPs (pristine or in vitro digested). The activity of the brush border membrane (BBM) enzymes intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), aminopeptidase-N (APN), sucrase isomaltase (SI) and the basolateral membrane enzyme (BLM) Na+/K+ATPase were assessed. Findings show that (i) the human digestion process alters the physicochemical properties of NPs, (ii) large agglomerates of NPs remain entrapped on the apical side of the intestinal barrier, which (iii) affects the activity of BBM enzymes. Interestingly, some NP effects were attenuated in the presence of either bacterial strain. Confocal microscopy detected bacteria-NP interactions, which may impede the NP-intestinal cell contact. These results highlight the importance of improving in vitro models to closely mimic the complexities of the human body. This journal is © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.</field>

		<field name="AB">The withdrawal of antibiotic growth promoters from poultry feed has increased the risk of necrotic enteritis (NE) outbreaks. This study examined the effects of a probiotic (PROB) or probiotic/prebiotic/essential oil supplement (PPEO) during a subclinical NE challenge. On day (d) of hatch, 960 male broilers were randomized to four groups (8 pens/treatment, 30 birds/pen) including (1) negative control (NC): corn-soybean meal diet; (2) positive control (PC): NC + 20 g Virginiamycin/ton diet; (3) NC + 227 g PROB/ton diet; and (4) NC + 453 g PPEO/ton diet. One d after placement, birds were challenged by a coccidia vaccine to induce NE. Feed intake and body weights were measured on d 8 (NE onset) and end of each feeding period. On d 8, the small intestines of three birds/pen were examined for NE lesions. Jejunum samples and ileal mucosal scrapings from one bird/pen were respectively collected to measure mRNA abundance (d 8 and d 14) and profile the microbiota (d 8 and d 42). Data were analyzed in JMP or QIIME 2 and significance between treatments identified by LSD (P &lt; 0.05). PROB and PPEO had significantly lower mortality (d 0–14) and NE lesion scores compared to NC. Feed conversion ratio was significantly lower in PC, PROB, and PPEO, while average daily gain was higher in PPEO and PC groups compared to NC from d 0–42. On d 8 and d 14, mRNA abundance of claudin-3 was higher in PPEO compared to NC. On d 14, compared to NC, mRNA abundance of sIgA and PGC-1α in PROB and PPEO were lower and higher, respectively. Compared to NC, PPEO increased mTOR abundance on d 14. On d 8, relative abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Ruminiclostridium9, Prevotellaceae, Prevotellaceae UCG-014, ASF356, and Muribaculaceae was higher in NC compared to PPEO and PROB, while Lactobacillus was lower in NC. Escherichia-Shigella had higher abundance in PC compared to PPEO and PROB. Collectively, these data indicate that during a subclinical naturally occurring NE, supplementation of PROB or PPEO supports performance and reduces intestinal lesions, potentially through modifying tight junction proteins, gut microbiota, immune responses, and cell metabolism. © Copyright © 2020 Emami, Calik, White, Kimminau and Dalloul.</field>

		<field name="AB">When owners decide to change their pet's food, a rapid transition may cause gastrointestinal distress. Yeast products may help with digestive upset during diet transition due to the bioactive compounds they possess, which may lead to improved intestinal morphology and integrity, modified gut microbiota, and modulated immune responses. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a yeast cell wall fraction supplement on measures of gut integrity and fecal characteristics of adult dogs undergoing an abrupt diet transition. Twelve adult female beagles (mean age: 5.16 ± 0.87 years; mean body weight: 13.37 ± 0.68 kg) were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with four 28-day experimental periods. During days 1–14, dogs were fed a dry kibble diet and supplemented with a placebo (cellulose; 125 mg/d) or yeast product (365 mg/d; equivalent to 0.2% of diet). During days 15–28, dogs remained on their placebo or yeast treatments but were rapidly transitioned to a canned diet or high-fiber diet. Fresh fecal samples were collected on days 13, 16, 20, 24, and 27 for measurement of pH, dry matter, calprotectin, immunoglobulin A (IgA), Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens. Blood samples were collected on days 14, 17, and 28 to measure serum lipopolysaccharide-binding protein concentrations. All data were analyzed using the Mixed Models procedure of SAS 9.4. Fecal pH, dry matter, calprotectin, IgA, and E. coli were not affected (P &gt; 0.05) by treatment before diet transition. Dogs supplemented with yeast cell wall fraction tended to have higher (P = 0.06) fecal C. perfringens counts than the controls. After diet transition, most parameters were not altered (P &gt; 0.05) by treatment except that yeast-supplemented dogs tended to have higher (P = 0.06) fecal IgA than controls. Our results suggest that the yeast product may modestly improve intestinal health after an abrupt diet transition in adult dogs by enhancing intestinal immunity. © Copyright © 2020 Lin, Carroll, Miller, Rabot and Swanson.</field>

		<field name="AB">The use of additives in food products has become an important public health concern. In recent reports, dietary emulsifiers have been shown to affect the gut microbiota, contributing to a pro-inflammatory phenotype and metabolic syndrome. So far, it is not yet known whether similar microbiome shifts are observable for a more diverse set of emulsifier types and to what extent these effects vary with the unique features of an individual’s microbiome. To bridge this gap, we investigated the effect of five dietary emulsifiers on the fecal microbiota from 10 human individuals upon a 48 h exposure. Community structure was assessed with quantitative microbial profiling, functionality was evaluated by measuring fermentation metabolites, and pro-inflammatory properties were assessed with the phylogenetic prediction algorithm PICRUSt, together with a TLR5 reporter cell assay for flagellin. A comparison was made between two mainstream chemical emulsifiers (carboxymethylcellulose and P80), a natural extract (soy lecithin), and biotechnological emulsifiers (sophorolipids and rhamnolipids). While fecal microbiota responded in a donor-dependent manner to the different emulsifiers, profound differences between emulsifiers were observed. Rhamnolipids, sophorolipids, and soy lecithin eliminated 91 ± 0, 89 ± 1, and 87 ± 1% of the viable bacterial population after 48 h, yet they all selectively increased the proportional abundance of putative pathogens. Moreover, profound shifts in butyrate (−96 ± 6, −73 ± 24, and −34 ± 25%) and propionate (+13 ± 24, +88 ± 50, and +29 ± 16%) production were observed for these emulsifiers. Phylogenetic prediction indicated higher motility, which was, however, not confirmed by increased flagellin levels using the TLR5 reporter cell assay. We conclude that dietary emulsifiers can severely impact the gut microbiota, and this seems to be proportional to their emulsifying strength, rather than emulsifier type or origin. As biotechnological emulsifiers were especially more impactful than chemical emulsifiers, caution is warranted when considering them as more natural alternatives for clean label strategies. © Copyright © 2020 Miclotte, De Paepe, Rymenans, Callewaert, Raes, Rajkovic, Van Camp and Van de Wiele.</field>

		<field name="AB">Vanillin is a phenolic food additive commonly used for flavor, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties. Though it is one of the widely used food additives, strategies of the human gut microbes to evade its antimicrobial activity await extensive elucidation. The current study explores the human gut microbiome with a multi-omics approach to elucidate its composition and metabolic machinery to counter vanillin bioactivity. A combination of SSU rRNA gene diversity, metagenomic RNA features diversity, phylogenetic affiliation of metagenome encoded proteins, uniformly (R = 0.99) indicates the abundance of Bacteroidetes followed by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Manual curation of metagenomic dataset identified gene clusters specific for the vanillin metabolism (ligV, ligK, and vanK) and intermediary metabolic pathways (pca and cat operon). Metagenomic dataset comparison identified the omnipresence of vanillin catabolic features across diverse populations. The metabolomic analysis brings forth the functionality of the vanillin catabolic pathway through the Protocatechuate branch of the beta-ketoadipate pathway. These results highlight the human gut microbial features and metabolic bioprocess involved in vanillin catabolism to overcome its antimicrobial activity. The current study advances our understanding of the human gut microbiome adaption toward changing dietary habits. © Copyright © 2020 Yadav, Pandey and Chauhan.</field>

		<field name="AB">Weaning is stressful for piglets involving nutritional, physiological, and psychological challenges, leading to an increase in the secretion of cortisol, changes in gut microbiome and metabolites, whereas the underlying relationships remain unclear. To elucidate this, 14 Meishan female piglets were divided into the weaning group and the suckling group at the age of 21 days paired by litter and body weight. After 48 h of experiment, weaned piglets had lower body weight, but higher salivary cortisol level than that of their suckling litter mates (P &lt; 0.05). The composition of the colonic bacterial community and metabolites were different between the two groups, and the first predominant genus of the suckling and weaned piglets colonic microbiome were Bacteroides and Prevotellaceae-NK3B31 group respectively. The suckling piglets had higher proportions of phylum Bacteroidetes and Lentisphaerae, and genus Bacteroides and Lactobacillus in the colonic microbial community, but lower abundance of genus Prevotellaceae-NK3B31 group than that of the weaned piglets (P &lt; 0.05). Accordingly, there were 15 colonic metabolites differed between the two groups, in which 2 metabolites (phenylacetic acid and phenol) negatively related to the abundant of Lactobacillus genus (P &lt; 0.05), while 9 metabolites (acetic acid, arabitol, benzoic acid, caprylic acid, cholesterol, dihydrocholesterol, galactinol, glucose phenol, phenylacetic acid, and oxamic acid, glycerol, propionic acid) positively associated with the proportion of Prevotellaceae-NK3B31 group genus (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the salivary cortisol level negatively associated with the abundance of phylum Lentisphaerae, but positively associated with the phylum Bacteroidetes and the genus Prevotellaceae-NK3B31 group (P &lt; 0.05) respectively. These results provide us with new insights into the cause of the gut microbiome and stress, and the contributions of gut microbiome in metabolic and physiological regulation in response to weaning stress. © Copyright © 2020 Jiang, Lu, Zhao, Yuan, Xia and Lei.</field>

		<field name="AB">Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease with reproductive dysfunction and metabolic disorder in women of childbearing age. Gastrointestinal microbiome contributes to PCOS through mediating insulin resistance. Guizhi Fuling Wan, Chinese herbal medicine, can treat PCOS with insulin resistance (PCOS-IR), but the underlying mechanism is not clear. The aim of this study was to characterize the exact mechanism of Guizhi Fuling Wan action and whether it is related to the regulation of intestinal flora structure. We induced PCOS-IR rat model by means of letrozole sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-na) solution combined with high-fat emulsion administration and randomly divided it into blank control group (K), model control group (M), low dose of Guizhi Fuling Wan group (D), middle dose of Guizhi Fuling Wan group (Z), high dose of Guizhi Fuling Wan group (G) and positive drug (Metformin) control group (Y). After 36 days of modeling and treatment, serum and stool samples from all rats were collected for a follow-up analysis. The data display that, compared with K group, elevated testosterone and HOMA-IR, turbulent estrous cycles and polycystic ovaries in M group, indicating the PCOS-IR rat model is successfully established. Increased fasting insulin is associated with higher inflammation(plasma TNF-α, IL-6, and HS-CPR concentration were determined) in M group, and the altered intestinal flora (compared with the K group, in M group the relative abundance of Alloprevotella was decreased significantly, while the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae UCG-008, Lachnospiraceae NK4A136, Lactobacillus, Ruminiclostridium 9, and Ruminococcaceae UCG-003 was increased significantly) induced the secretion of inflammatory markers. On the other hand, Guizhi Fuling Wan can alleviate inflammation, improve insulin resistence: Lower inflammation decreased fasting insulin can be seen in G group compared with M group, this effect is related to the regulating effect of Guizhi Fuling Wan on intestinal flora (in G group, the relative abundance of Alloprevotella, Ruminococcaceae UCG-003, and Lachnospiraceae UCG-008 was increased significantly, compared with M group). This research demonstrates Guizhi Fuling Wan improve insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome with the underlying mechanism of regulating intestinal flora to control inflammation. It would be useful to promote the therapeutic effect of Guizhi Fuling Wan on PCOS-IR. © Copyright © 2020 Zhu, Li, Liu, Hu and Zhu.</field>

		<field name="AB">Berries are rich in polyphenols and plant cell wall polysaccharides (fibers), including cellulose, hemicellulose, arabinans and arabino-xyloglucans rich pectin. Most of polyphenols and fibers are known to be poorly absorbed in the small intestine and reach the colon where they interact with the gut microbiota, conferring health benefits to the host. This study assessed the contribution of polyphenol-rich whole cranberry and blueberry fruit powders (CP and BP), and that of their fibrous fractions (CF and BF) on modulating the gut microbiota, the microbial functional profile and influencing metabolic disorders induced by high-fat high-sucrose (HFHS) diet for 8 weeks. Lean mice-associated taxa, including Akkermansia muciniphila, Dubosiella newyorkensis, and Angelakisella, were selectively induced by diet supplementation with polyphenol-rich CP and BP. Fiber-rich CF also triggered polyphenols-degrading families Coriobacteriaceae and Eggerthellaceae. Diet supplementation with polyphenol-rich CP, but not with its fiber-rich CF, reduced fat mass depots, body weight and energy efficiency in HFHS-fed mice. However, CF reduced liver triglycerides in HFHS-fed mice. Importantly, polyphenol-rich CP-diet normalized microbial functions to a level comparable to that of Chow-fed controls. Using multivariate association modeling, taxa and predicted functions distinguishing an obese phenotype from healthy controls and berry-treated mice were identified. The enterotype-like clustering analysis underlined the link between a long-term diet intake and the functional stratification of the gut microbiota. The supplementation of a HFHS-diet with polyphenol-rich CP drove mice gut microbiota from Firmicutes/Ruminococcus enterotype into an enterotype linked to healthier host status, which is Prevotella/Akkermansiaceae. This study highlights the prebiotic role of polyphenols, and their contribution to the compositional and functional modulation of the gut microbiota, counteracting obesity. © Copyright © 2020 Rodríguez-Daza, Roquim, Dudonné, Pilon, Levy, Marette, Roy and Desjardins.</field>

		<field name="AB">Dung beetles are holometabolous insects that feed on herbivorous mammal dung and provide services to the ecosystem including nutrient cycling and soil fertilization. It has been suggested that organisms developing on incomplete diets such as dungs require the association with microorganisms for the synthesis and utilization of nutrients. We describe the diversity and composition of the gut-microbiota during the life cycle of the dung beetle Copris incertus using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that C. incertus gut contained a broad diversity of bacterial groups (1,699 OTUs and 302 genera). The taxonomic composition varied during the beetle life cycle, with the predominance of some bacterial genera in a specific developmental stage (Mothers: Enterobacter and Serratia; Eggs: Nocardioides and Hydrogenophaga; Larval and pupal stages: Dysgonomonas and Parabacteroides; offspring: Ochrobactrum). The beta diversity evidenced similarities among developmental stages, clustering (i) the adult stages (mother, male and female offsprings), (ii) intermediate developmental (larvae and pupa), and (iii) initial stage (egg). Microbiota differences could be attributed to dietary specialization or/and morpho-physiological factors involved in the transition from a developmental stage to the next. The predicted functional profile (PICRUSt2 analysis) for the development bacterial core of the level 3 categories, indicated grouping by developmental stage. Only 36 categories were significant in the SIMPER analysis, including the metabolic categories of amino acids and antibiotic synthesis, which were enriched in the larval and pupal stages; both categories are involved in the metamorphosis process. At the gene level, we found significant differences only in the KOs encoding functions related to nitrogen fixation, uric acid metabolism, and plant cell wall degradation for all developmental stages. Nitrogen fixation and plant cell wall degradation were enriched in the intermediate stages and uric acid metabolism was enriched in mothers. The data reported here suggested the influence of the maternal microbiota in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota of the offspring. © Copyright © 2020 Suárez-Moo, Cruz-Rosales, Ibarra-Laclette, Desgarennes, Huerta and Lamelas.</field>

		<field name="AB">Many studies have investigated the anti-obesity effects of probiotics in animal models and humans. However, few studies have focused on the mechanisms of obesity-inducing probiotics. In a previous study, we demonstrated that specific bacterial strains isolated from kefir, Lactobacillus kefirnofaciens M1 and Lactobacillus mali APS1, possess obesity and anti-obesity effects, respectively, in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Thus, in the present study, we systematically investigated whether APS1 and M1 affect energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism in HFD-induced obese mice and how this might be achieved. We observed that the M1/APS1 intervention influenced fat accumulation by regulating adipogenesis and inflammation-related marker expression both in vitro and in a HFD induced C57BL/6J mice model. We also observed putative links between key taxa and possible metabolic processes of the gut microbiota. Notably, families Christensenellaceae and S24_7 were negatively correlated with body weight gain through increase in the essential esterized carnitine for energy expenditure. These results suggest the importance of specific probiotic interventions affecting leanness and obesity of subjects under a HFD, which are operated by modulating the tripartite relationship among the host, microbiota, and metabolites. © Copyright © 2020 Lin, Chen, Li and Chen.</field>

		<field name="AB">Nanomaterials (NMs) can interact with the innate immunity of organisms. It remains, however, unclear whether these interactions can compromise the immune functioning of the host when faced with a disease threat. Co-exposure with pathogens is thus a powerful approach to assess the immuno-safety of NMs. In this paper, we studied the impacts of in vivo exposure to a biocidal NM on the gut microbiome, host immune responses, and susceptibility of the host to a bacterial challenge in an earthworm. Eisenia fetida were exposed to CuO-nanoparticles in soil for 28 days, after which the earthworms were challenged with the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Immune responses were monitored by measuring mRNA levels of known earthworm immune genes. Effects of treatments on the gut microbiome were also assessed to link microbiome changes to immune responses. Treatments caused a shift in the earthworm gut microbiome. Despite these effects, no impacts of treatment on the expression of earthworm immune markers were recorded. The methodological approach applied in this paper provides a useful framework for improved assessment of immuno-safety of NMs. In addition, we highlight the need to investigate time as a factor in earthworm immune responses to NM exposure. © 2020 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">The secretion of extracellular vesicles, EVs, is a common process in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells for intercellular communication, survival, and pathogenesis. Previous studies have illustrated the presence of EVs in supernatants from pure cultures of bacteria, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative glycan-degrading gut commensals. However, the isolation and characterization of EVs secreted by a complex microbial community have not been clearly reported. In a recent paper, we showed that wood-derived, complex β-mannan, which shares a structural similarity with conventional dietary fibers, can be used to modulate the porcine gut microbiota composition and activity. In this paper, we investigated the production, size, composition, and proteome of EVs secreted by pig fecal microbiota after 24 h enrichment on complex β-mannan. Using transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis, we identified EVs with an average size of 165 nm. We utilized mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic profiling of EV proteins against a database of 355 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the porcine colon and thereby identified 303 proteins. For EVs isolated from the culture grown on β-mannan, most proteins mapped to two MAGs, MAG53 and MAG272, belonging to the orders Clostridiales and Bacilli, respectively. Furthermore, the MAG with the third-most-detected protein was MAG 343, belonging to the order Enterobacteriales. The most abundant proteins detected in the β-mannan EVs proteome were involved in translation, energy production, amino acid, and carbohydrate transport, as well as metabolism. Overall, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates the successful isolation of EVs released from a complex microbial community; furthermore, the protein content of the EVs reflects the response of specific microbes to the available carbohydrate source. © 2020 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Radiation therapy is a cornerstone of modern management methods for malignancies but is accompanied by diverse side effects. In the present study, we showed that food additives such as polysorbate 80 (P80) exacerbate irradiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) tract toxicity. A 16S ribosomal RNA high-throughput sequencing analysis indicated that P80 consumption altered the abundance and composition of the gut microbiota, leading to severe radiation-induced GI tract injury. Mice harboring fecal microbes from P80-treated mice were highly susceptible to irradiation, and antibiotics-challenged mice also represented more sensitive to radiation following P80 treatment. Importantly, butyrate, a major metabolite of enteric microbial fermentation of dietary fibers, exhibited beneficial effects against P80 consumption-aggravated intestinal toxicity via the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and maintenance of the intestinal bacterial composition in irradiated animals. Moreover, butyrate had broad therapeutic effects on common radiation-induced injury. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that P80 are potential risk factors for cancer patients during radiotherapy and indicate that butyrate might be employed as a therapeutic option to mitigate the complications associated with radiotherapy. © Copyright © 2020 Li, Xiao, Dong, Luo, Wang, Zhang, Zhu, Zhu, Cui and Fan.</field>

		<field name="AB">Sucralose is a calorie-free high-intensity artificial sweetener that is widely used in thousands of foods and beverages all over the world. Although it was initially regarded as a safe, inert food additive, its adverse effect on gut microbiota and health has drawn more and more attention as evidence accumulates. Studies by us and others revealed that sucralose exacerbated gut damage and inflammation in animal models for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including those for both ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. Our study demonstrated that sucralose greatly aggravated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis along with causing changes in gut microbiota, the gut barrier and impaired inactivation of digestive proteases mediated by deconjugated bilirubin. It is well-documented that IBD greatly increases the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), the globally third-most-common cancer, which, like IBD, has a high rate in the developed countries. Azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS has been the most commonly used animal model for CRC. In this study, we further explored the effect of sucralose on tumorigenesis and the possible mechanism involved using the AOM/DSS mouse model. First, 1.5 mg/ml sucralose was included in the drinking water for 6 weeks to reach a relatively stable phase of impact on gut microbiota. Then, 10 mg/kg AOM was administered through intraperitoneal injection. Seven days later, 2.5% DSS was put in the drinking water for 5 days, followed by 2 weeks without DSS. The 5 days of DSS was then repeated, and the mice were sacrificed 6 weeks after AOM injection. The results showed that sucralose caused significant increases in the number and size of AOM/DSS-induced colorectal tumors along with changes in other parameters such as body and spleen weight, pathological scores, mortality, fecal β-glucuronidase and digestive proteases, gut barrier molecules, gut microbiota, inflammatory cytokines and pathways (TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TLR4/Myd88/NF-κB signaling), and STAT3/VEGF tumor-associated signaling pathway molecules. These results suggest that sucralose may increase tumorigenesis along with dysbiosis of gut microbiota, impaired inactivation of digestive protease, damage to the gut barrier, and exacerbated inflammation. © Copyright © 2020 Li, Liu, Wang, Li, Liu, Guo, Tan, Qin, Wang and Jiang.</field>

		<field name="AB">Earthworms are important members of the soil macrofauna that play a significant role in soil structure and fertility. However, there is scanty information on the earthworm gut microbial flora and their metabolic potential. In the present study, the diversity of the microbial community and their metabolic potential from the gut content of four different earthworm species from Indo-Myanmar Biodiversity Hotspot were collected and identified by standard methods. The microbial diversity and their metabolic potential were assessed by high throughput sequencing of V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA using Illumina technology. Analysis of microbial diversity was performed by QIIME software package v.1.8.0 with their metabolic potential by PICRUSt (v1.1) software package. A total of 3,36,047 processed sequences were obtained that generated 3686 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Major bacterial phyla identified were Proteobacteria (47.1%), Firmicutes (38.9%), Actinobacteria (6.3%), Bacteroidetes (3.6%) and Cyanobacteria (1.1%). The abundant genera were Lysinibacillus (26.9%), Acinetobacter (21.2%), Pseudomonas (4.7%), Bacillus (3.8%), Staphylococcus (3.5%), Stenotrophomonas (1.1%) and Ralstonia (1%). The functional annotation of the metagenome revealed abundance of bacterial community associated with amino acid, carbohydrate as well as energy metabolism. Furthermore, the presence of enzymes involved in the process of denitrification and methanogenesis were also identified. This study gives insight into the gut microbial composition and their putative functional roles in the gut of tropical hilly earthworms. The study on forest and garden soil earthworm gut microbiomes might help us understand the role of these organisms in their respective ecosystems. © The Author(s) 2020.</field>

		<field name="AB">Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancerrelated mortality worldwide. While cirrhosis is the main risk factor for HCC, the factors influencing progression from cirrhosis to HCC remain largely unknown. Gut microbiota plays a key role in liver diseases; however, its association with HCC remains elusive. This study aimed to elucidate microbial differences between patients with HCC-associated cirrhosis (HCC-cirrhosis) and cirrhotic patients without HCC and healthy volunteers and to explore the associations between diet, lifestyle, and the microbiome of these patients. Fecal samples and food frequency questionnaires were collected from 95 individuals (30 HCC-cirrhosis patients, 38 cirrhotic patients without HCC, and 27 age- and body mass index [BMI]-matched healthy volunteers). 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed. Bacterial richness in cirrhosis and HCCcirrhosis patients was significantly lower than in healthy controls. The HCC-cirrhosis group was successfully classified with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.9 based on the dysbiotic fecal microbial signature. The HCC-cirrhosis group had a significant overrepresentation of Clostridium and CF231 and reduced Alphaproteobacteria abundance compared to cirrhotic patients without HCC. Patients with HCCcirrhosis who were overweight displayed significantly decreased bacterial richness and altered microbiota composition compared to their normal-weight counterparts. There was a significant correlation in the HCC-cirrhosis group between intake of artificial sweeteners and the presence of Akkermansia muciniphila. A unique microbial signature was observed in patients with HCC-cirrhosis, irrespective of cirrhosis stage, diet, or treatment. BMI, dietary sugar, and artificial sweeteners were significantly associated with alterations in the microbiome of HCC-cirrhosis patients. However, the increased abundance of Clostridium and CF231 observed in HCC-cirrhosis patients was not influenced by environmental factors, implying that this change was due to development of HCC. Importance: Development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis is associated with alterations in intestinal microbiota, including an escalation of dysbiosis and reduced bacterial richness. This study demonstrates that reduced bacterial richness and dysbiosis escalate with the progression of cirrhosis from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis and to HCC-associated cirrhosis (HCC-cirrhosis). Moreover, we report for the first time the effect of environmental factors on HCCcirrhosis. Excess weight was associated with increased dysbiosis in patients with HCC compared to their normal-weight counterparts. Moreover, fatty liver, consumption of artificial sweeteners, and high-sugar foods were associated with altered microbial composition, including altered levels of Akkermansia muciniphila in HCC-cirrhosis. We have successfully determined that levels of Alphaproteobacteria and the two genera CF231 and Clostridium are significantly altered in cirrhotic patients who develop hepatocellular carcinoma, independently of cirrhosis severity and dietary habits. © 2020 Lapidot et al.</field>

		<field name="AB">Herbal tea residue (HTR) is a reusable resource with high nutritional value and bioactive substances content, which can be used as a feed additive. In the present study, HTRs were fermented by lactic acid bacteria, and then fed to a total of 90 Holstein heifers, termed as CN, LC, and HC groups. The supplementation improved physiological indices of respiratory frequency and rectal temperature, increased the concentrations of immunoglobulins and antioxidant capacity-related parameters, and reduced the concentrations of heat stress-related parameters and serum hormones. The heifers’ body height increased considerably, while their energy metabolism rates were stimulated in response to fermented HTRs. We also studied the fecal microbial community composition of 8 Holstein heifers in each group, and employed correlation analysis with tested parameters. We found that the bacteria were closely related to characteristics including the energy utilization rate, growth performance, serum biochemical indexes, and fecal SCFA levels of the heifers. Based on our findings, the 5% fermented HTRs replaced corn silage might be advantageous for the heifers’ characteristics under heat stress. © Copyright © 2020 Xie, Chen, Wang, Chen, Sun, He, Luo, Chen, Xi, Zhang and Sun.</field>

		<field name="AB">Dietary emulsifiers are widely used in industrially processed foods, although the effects of these food additives on human gut microbiota are not well studied. Here, we investigated the effects of five different emulsifiers [glycerol monoacetate, glycerol monostearate, glycerol monooleate, propylene glycol monostearate, and sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL)] on fecal microbiota in vitro. We found that 0.025% (w/v) of SSL reduced the relative abundance of the bacterial class Clostridia and others. The relative abundance of the families Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae was substantially reduced whereas that of Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae was increased. Given the marked impact of SSL on Clostridia, we used genome reconstruction to predict community-wide production of short-chain fatty acids, which were experimentally assessed by GC-MS analysis. SSL significantly reduced concentrations of butyrate, and increased concentrations of propionate compared to control cultures. The presence of SSL increased lipopolysaccharide, LPS and flagellin in cultured communities, thereby enhancing the proinflammatory potential of SSL-selected bacterial communities. © Copyright © 2020 Elmén, Zlamal, Scott, Lee, Chen, Colas, Rodionov and Peterson.</field>

		<field name="AB">A high-fat (HF) diet is a major predisposing factor of neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits. Recently, changes in the gut microbiota have been associated with neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment, through the gut-brain axis. Curdlan, a bacterial polysaccharide widely used as food additive, has the potential to alter the composition of the microbiota and improve the gut-brain axis. However, the effects of curdlan against HF diet-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive decline have not been investigated. We aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect and mechanism of dietary curdlan supplementation against the obesity-associated cognitive decline observed in mice fed a HF diet. C57Bl/6J male mice were fed with either a control, HF, or HF with curdlan supplementation diets for 7 days (acute) or 15 weeks (chronic). We found that acute curdlan supplementation prevented the gut microbial composition shift induced by HF diet. Chronic curdlan supplementation prevented cognitive declines induced by HF diet. In addition, curdlan protected against the HF diet-induced abnormities in colonic permeability, hyperendotoxemia, and colonic inflammation. Furthermore, in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus, curdlan mitigated microgliosis, neuroinflammation, and synaptic impairments induced by a HF diet. Thus, curdlan—as a food additive and prebiotic—can prevent cognitive deficits induced by HF diet via the colon-brain axis. © Copyright © 2020 Yang, Zheng, Hao, Shi, Lin, Chen, Becvarovski, Pan, Zhang, Hu, Huang, Zheng and Yu.</field>

		<field name="AB">Microbiota in the kangaroo gut degrade cellulose, contributing to the kangaroo’s energy and survival. In this preliminary study, to discover more about the gut microbes that contribute to the survival of kangaroos, cellulose-degrading bacteria were isolated from kangaroo scats by selection on solidified media containing carboxymethyl cellulose as the main carbon source. One frequently occurring aerobic bacterium was Siccibacter turicensis, a microbe previously isolated in fruit powder and from a patient with angular cheilitis. The whole genome sequence of the kangaroo isolate was obtained using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Its sequence shared 97.98% identity of the S. turicensis Type strain, and the ability of the Type strain to degrade cellulose was confirmed. Analysis of the genomic data focused on the cellulose operon. In addition to genes from the operon, we suggest that a gene following the operon may have an important role in regulating cellulose metabolism by signal transduction. This is the first report of S. turicensis found within microbiota of the animal gut. Because of its frequent presence in the kangaroo gut, we suggest that S. turicensis plays a role in cellulose digestion for kangaroos. © 2020 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">This study investigated the transfer of plastic debris in a terrestrial environment from the soil to a plant (the mung bean, Vigna radiata), and then to a consumer (the African giant snail, Achatina fulica). Adverse effects of these plastic pollutants on the physiology of the plant and animal were investigated. The mung bean plants were directly exposed to nanoplastics (NPs) by adding NPs to the soil for 10 days. The snails were indirectly exposed by feeding them for 14 days the leaves of mung bean plants that had internalized NPs. We found that NPs decreased their root growth (82.9 and 83.3% of control growth at low and high concentrations, respectively) and led to particle accumulation in the leaves of the mung bean plants. Meanwhile, the growth rate (77.1 and 62.0% of the control rate at low and high concentrations, respectively) and feeding and foraging speeds (63.4 and 54.0% of control speeds at low and high concentrations, respectively) of the snails were decreased by dietary NP intake. This was associated with decreased gut microbiota viability and histological damage to the digestive organ tissues of the snails. Thus, NPs negatively affect the growth of plants and the animals that consume them in terrestrial ecosystems, which could have adverse effects at higher trophic levels.

		<field name="AB">Prebiotic carbohydrates are compounds that include simple sugars, sugar alcohols, and raffinose family oligosaccharides, which are fermented by gut bacteria and can influence the species profile of the gut microbiome to reduce obesity and weight gain. Prebiotic carbohydrates are also associated with several health benefits including reduced insulin dependence and incidence of colorectal cancer. Although pulse crops such as chickpea have been important sources of nutrition for human diets for thousands of years, relatively little is known about the profiles of prebiotic carbohydrates in pulse crops. The objectives of this study were to characterize the type and concentration of seed prebiotic carbohydrates in 18 kabuli chickpea genotypes grown in 2017 and 2018 in Idaho and Washington, and partition variance components conditioning these nutritional quality traits in chickpea. Genotype effects were significant for fructose, sucrose, raffinose, and kestose. Environment effects were also significant for several carbohydrates. However, year effects were the greatest sources of variance for all carbohydrates. Concentrations of most carbohydrates were significantly greater in 2017, when there was less precipitation during the growing season coupled with greater heat stress during grain filling than in 2018. This may reflect the role of many of these carbohydrates as osmoprotectants produced in response to heat and water stress. Overall, our results suggest that a survey of more genetically diverse plant materials, such as a chickpea ‘mini-core' collection, may reveal genotypes that produce significantly greater concentrations of selected prebiotic carbohydrates and could be used to introduce desirable nutritional traits into adapted chickpea cultivars. © Copyright © 2020 Vandemark, Thavarajah, Siva and Thavarajah.</field>

		<field name="AB">Human colon microbiota, composed of hundreds of different species, is closely associated with several health conditions. Controlled in vitro cultivation and up-to-date analytical methods make possible the systematic evaluation of the underlying mechanisms of complex interactions between the members of microbial consortia. Information on reproducing fecal microbial consortia can be used for various clinical and biotechnological applications. In this study, chemostat and changestat cultures were used to elucidate the effects of the physiologically relevant range of dilution rates on the growth and metabolism of adult fecal microbiota. The dilution rate was kept either at D = 0.05 or D = 0.2 1/h in chemostat cultures, while gradually changing from 0.05 to 0.2 1/h in the A-stat and from 0.2 to 0.05 1/h in the De-stat. Apple pectin as a substrate was used in the chemostat experiments and apple pectin or birch xylan in the changestat experiments, in the presence of porcine mucin in all cases. The analyses were comprised of HPLC for organic acids, UPLC for amino acids, GC for gas composition, 16S-rDNA sequencing for microbial composition, and growth parameter calculations. It was shown that the abundance of most bacterial taxa was determined by the dilution rate on both substrates. Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Faecalibacterium were prevalent within the whole range of dilution rates. Akkermansia muciniphila and Ruminococcaceae UCG-013 were significantly enriched at D = 0.05 1/h, while Bacteroides caccae, Lachnospiraceae unclassified and Escherichia coli clearly preferred D = 0.2 1/h. In the chemostat cultures, the production of organic acids and gases from pectin was related to the dilution rate. The ratio of acetate, propionate and butyrate was 5:2:1 (D = 0.05 1/h) and 14:2:1 (D = 0.2 1/h). It was shown that the growth rate-related characteristics of the fecal microbiota were concise in both directions between D = 0.05 and 0.2 1/h. Reproducible adaptation of the fecal microbiota was shown in the continuous culture with a changing dilution rate: changestat. Consortia cultivation is a promising approach for research purposes and several biotechnological applications, including the production of multi-strain probiotics and fecal transplantation mixtures. © Copyright © 2020 Adamberg, Raba and Adamberg.</field>

		<field name="AB">Efficacious therapies are not available for the cure of both gliomas and glioneuronal tumors, which represent the most numerous and heterogeneous primary cancers of the central nervous system (CNS), and for neoplasms of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which can be divided into benign tumors, mainly represented by schwannomas and neurofibromas, and malignant tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath (MPNST). Increased cellular oxidative stress and other metabolic aspects have been reported as potential etiologies in the nervous system tumors. Thus polyphenols have been tested as effective natural compounds likely useful for the prevention and therapy of this group of neoplasms, because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. However, polyphenols show poor intestinal absorption due to individual intestinal microbiota content, poor bioavailability, and difficulty in passing the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Recently, polymeric nanoparticle-based polyphenol delivery improved their gastrointestinal absorption, their bioavailability, and entry into defined target organs. Herein, we summarize recent findings about the primary polyphenols employed for nervous system tumor prevention and treatment. We describe the limitations of their application in clinical practice and the new strategies aimed at enhancing their bioavailability and targeted delivery. © 2020 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Recent advances have revealed the essential role of gut microbiomes in the therapeutic efficiency of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Inspired by biostimulation, a method using nutrients to accelerate the growth of soil microorganisms and the recovery of soil microbial consortia, here we propose a bilberry anthocyanin combo containing chitosan and low molecular citrus pectin (LCP), in which LCP–chitosan is used to encapsulate anthocyanins so to enhance its digestive stability and, moreover, modulate the microbiome more favorable for the PD-L1 blockade treatment. Using murine MC38 colon cancer as a model system, we examined the effects of the combo on modulating the gut microbiome and therapeutic efficiency of PD-L1 blockade treatment. It was shown that bilberry anthocyanins enriched the subdominant species, increased both the concentration and the proportion of butyrate in feces and enhanced intratumoral CD8+ T cell infiltrations. The application of the bilberry anthocyanin combo restored the species diversity of gut microbiome decreased by LCP–chitosan and achieved the best control of tumor growth. These preliminary results indicated unprecedented opportunities of probiotics combo in improving the therapeutic efficiency of immune checkpoint inhibitor through manipulating gut microbiome. © 2020 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Introduction: Indonesians have a low intake of dietary fibre, a key component for an increased incidence in constipation. Available data have documented the benefits of polydextrose (PDX) in healthy subjects. However, data on constipated subjects are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the effect of consuming a PDX (prebiotic) beverage on bowel habits and gastrointestinal symptoms of constipated subjects over seven days. Methods: This was a randomised, non-blinded, non-placebo-controlled parallel design study involving 24 subjects, divided equally into two groups. Group A (active control group) consisted of 12 subjects, consuming one serving size of 6g PDX beverage. While Group B (intervention group) consisted of 12 subjects, consuming two servings of the same product, containing 12g PDX beverage. Changes in bowel habits (constipation score, stool frequency and stool consistency) and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating and flatulence) were monitored. Results: Within seven days, Group B showed 4.9% more reduction in overall constipation mean score than that of Group A. Positive improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms were reported: i.e. abdominal pain (ΔM = −0.08±0.43), bloating (ΔM = −0.29±0.37) and flatulence (ΔM = −0.17±0.47). Majority of subjects had desirable stool frequency (87.5%, &gt;3 defecations/week) and stool consistency (58.3%, type 4). These improvements were due to the fact that PDX provides physiological effects consistent with prebiotic fibre, which alters the gut microbiota composition during the fermentation cycle in the large intestine. Conclusion: Findings of this study suggested that daily PDX beverage consumption effectively improved bowel habits, with fewer constipated subjects reporting of gastrointestinal symptoms. © 2020.

		<field name="AB">Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing immune-mediated disease of the intestinal tract. Although its prevalence is reportedly lower in Asia than in Western countries, the rapid increase in the incidence of IBD has drawn attention to its etiology, including genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. Specifically, recent studies concerning dietary treatments and intestinal microbiota suggest that these factors may interact with the immune system, and the imbalance of this relationship may lead to immune dysregulation in IBD. Changes in diet or alterations in the composition of the intestinal microbiota may be associated with the increasing incidence of IBD in Asia. Here, we aim to review recent studies on the role of diet and intestinal microbiota in IBD pathogenesis and the results of the investigations performed to modulate these factors. © 2020 by The Korean Pediatric Society.</field>

		<field name="AB">The effects of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) on the gut microbiota are an area of increasing research interest due to their potential influence on weight gain, insulin resistance, and inflammation. Studies have shown that mice and rats fed saccharin develop weight gain and metabolic alterations, possibly related to changes in gut microbiota. Here, we hypothesized that chronic exposure to a commercial NNS would change the gut microbiota composition in Wistar rats when compared to sucrose exposure. To test this hypothesis, Wistar rats were fed either NNS-or su-crose-supplemented yogurt for 17 weeks alongside standard chow (ad libitum). The gut microbiome was assessed by 16S rDNA deep sequencing. Assembly and quantification were conducted using the Brazilian Microbiome Project pipeline for Ion Torrent data with modifications. Statistical analyses were performed in the R software environment. We found that chronic feeding of a commercial NNS-sweetened yogurt to Wistar rats, within the recommended dose range, did not significantly modify gut microbiota composition in comparison to sucrose-sweetened yogurt. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that moderate exposure to NNS is associated with changes in gut microbiota pattern compared to sucrose, at least in this experimental model. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.</field>

		<field name="AB">The use of prebiotics to regulate gut microbiota is a promising strategy to improve gut health. Pectin (PEC) is a prebiotic carbohydrate that enhances the health of the gut by promoting the growth of beneficial microbes. These microbes produce metabolites that are known to improve mucosal immune responses. This study was conducted to better understand effects of PEC on the microbiome and mucosal immunity in pigs. Pigs were fed two diets, with or without 5% apple PEC, for 72 days. Effects of PEC on the microbiota, cytokine expression, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentration and barrier function were examined in the ileum and cecum of the pigs. An integrative analysis was used to determine interactions of PEC consumption with bacterial metabolites and microbiome composition and host mucosal responses. Consumption of PEC reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and IL-18, and the activation of the pro-inflammatory NF-B signaling cascade. Expression of MUC2 and TFF and the sIgA content was upregulated in the mucosa of PEC-fed pigs. Network analysis revealed that PEC induced significant interactions between microbiome composition in the ileum and cecum on mucosal immune pathways. PEC-induced changes in bacterial genera and fermentation metabolites, such as Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, Oscillibacter, Lawsonia and butyrate, correlated with the differentially expressed genes and cytokines in the mucosa. In summary, the results demonstrate the anti-inflammatory properties of PEC on mucosal immune status in the ileum and cecum effected through modulation of the host microbiome. © 2020 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Intestinal microbiota plays an important role in human health. The aim of this paper is to determine the impact of the phenolics and carbohydrate in buckwheat honey on human intestinal microbiota. We investigated the phenolics and carbohydrate compositions of eight buckwheat honey samples using high-performance liquid chromatography and ion chromatography. The human intestinal microbes were cultured in a medium supplemented with eight buckwheat honey samples or the same concentration of fructooligosaccharides. The bacterial 16S rDNA V4 region sequence of DNA extraction was determined by the Illumina MiSeq platform. 12 phenolics and 4 oligosaccharides were identified in almost all buckwheat honey samples, namely, protocatechuic acid, 4-hydroxy benzoic acid, vanillin, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, benzoic acid, isoferulic acid, methyl syringate, trans,trans-abscisic acid, cis,trans-abscisic acid, ferulic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, kestose, isomaltose, isomaltotriose, and panose. Most notably, this is the first study to reveal the presence of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde in buckwheat honey. 4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde seems to be a land marker of buckwheat honey. Our results indicate that buckwheat honey can provide health benefits to the human gut by selectively supporting the growth of indigenous Bifidobacteria and restraining the pathogenic bacterium in the gut tract.

		<field name="AB">Elimination or alteration of select members of the gut microbiota is key to therapeutic efficacy. However, the complexity of these microbial inhabitants makes it challenging to precisely target bacteria. Here, we deliver exogenous genes to specific bacteria by genomic integration of temperate phage for long-lasting modification. As a real-world therapeutic test, we engineered λ phage to transcriptionally repress Shiga toxin by using genetic hybrids between λ and other lambdoid phages to overcome resistance encoded by the virulence-expressing prophage. We show that a single dose of engineered phage propagates throughout the bacterial community and reduces Shiga toxin production in an enteric mouse model of infection without markedly affecting bacterial concentrations. Our work reveals a new framework for transferring functions to bacteria within their native environment. IMPORTANCE With the increasing frequency of antibiotic resistance, it is critical to explore new therapeutic strategies for treating bacterial infections. Here, we use a temperate phage, i.e., one that integrates itself into the bacterial genome, to neutralize the expression of a virulence factor by modifying bacterial function at the genetic level. We show that Shiga toxin production can be significantly reduced in vitro and in the mammalian gut. Alternative to traditional applications of phage therapy that rely on killing bacteria, our genetics-based antivirulence approach introduces a new framework for treating bacterial infections. © 2020 Hsu et al.</field>

		<field name="AB">A major function of the gut microbiota is to provide colonization resistance, wherein pathogens are inhibited or suppressed below infectious levels. However, the fraction of gut microbiota required for colonization resistance remains unclear. We used culturomics to isolate a gut microbiota culture collection comprising 1,590 isolates belonging to 102 species. This culture collection represents 34.57% of the taxonomic diversity and 70% functional capacity, as estimated by metagenomic sequencing of the fecal samples used for culture. Using whole-genome sequencing, we characterized species representatives from this collection and predicted their phenotypic traits, further characterizing isolates by defining nutrient utilization profiles and short-chain fatty acid production. When screened with a coculture assay, 66 species in our culture collection inhibited Clostridioides difficile. Several phenotypes, particularly, growth rate, production of SCFAs, and the utilization of mannitol, sorbitol, or succinate, correlated with C. difficile inhibition. We used a combinatorial community assembly approach to formulate defined bacterial mixes inhibitory to C. difficile. We tested 256 combinations and found that both species composition and blend size were important in inhibition. Our results show that the interaction of bacteria with one another in a mix and with other members of gut commensals must be investigated to design defined bacterial mixes for inhibiting C. difficile in vivo. IMPORTANCE Antibiotic treatment causes instability of gut microbiota and the loss of colonization resistance, thus allowing pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile to colonize and causing recurrent infection and mortality. Although fecal microbiome transplantation has been shown to be an effective treatment for C. difficile infection (CDI), a more desirable approach would be the use of a defined mix of inhibitory gut bacteria. The C. difficile-inhibiting species and bacterial combinations identified herein improve the understanding of the ecological interactions controlling colonization resistance against C. difficile and could aid in the design of defined bacteriotherapy as a nonantibiotic alternative against CDI.

		<field name="AB">The experiment was designed to determine the effect of different levels of chicory (Chicorium intybus L.) powder and a probiotic blend (PrimaLac®) on productive performance, blood biochemical parameters, and ileal microbiota in broiler chickens. A total of 225 one-day-old broilers (Ross 308) were used in a completely randomized design with five experimental diets as follows: 1—basal-diet without supplements (control-group); 2—basal-diet including probiotic blend; 3— basal-diet including 0.10% chicory; 4—basal-diet including 0.15% chicory; 5—basal-diet including 0.20% chicory. At 42 days of age, representative birds per replicate were randomly selected for blood samples and carcass measurements. Results showed that the body weight gain of broilers fed the probiotic blend or 0.10% chicory was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than those fed on the other treatments. The abdominal fat pad was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower in birds fed diets including chicory compared with control or probiotic. Blood triglycerides and LDL levels were reduced (P &lt; 0.05) and HDL increased (P &lt; 0.05) when fed probiotic or chicory whereas no significant effect on the other serum parameters was found. Broiler ileal microflora from the control group had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher count of E. coli and lower Lactobacillus than those from the other groups. From findings, it is possible to conclude that dietary chicory powder supported positively growth performance and improved gut microbiota in broiler chickens. However, more research is needed on this subject to better understand the mode of action of feed additives used. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</field>

		<field name="AB">Emulsifiers are common components of processed foods consumed as part of a Western diet. Emerging in vitro cell-line culture, mouse model and human intestinal tissue explant studies have all suggested that very low concentrations of the food emulsifier polysorbate 80 may cause bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelium, intestinal inflammation and metabolic syndrome. This raises the possibility that dietary emulsifiers might be factors in conditions such as coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes and Crohn's disease. The potential mechanism behind the observed effects of this emulsifier is uncertain but may be mediated via changes in the gut microbiota or by increased bacterial translocation, or both. It is also unknown whether these effects are generalisable across all emulsifiers and detergents, including perhaps the natural emulsifier lecithin or even conjugated bile acids, particularly if the latter escape reabsorption and pass through to the distal ileum or colon. A major objective of the Medical Research Council (MRC)-funded Mechanistic Nutrition in Health (MECNUT) Emulsifier project is therefore to investigate the underlying mechanisms and effects of a range of synthetic and natural emulsifiers and detergents in vitro and in vivo, and to determine the effects of a commonly consumed emulsifier (soya lecithin) on gut and metabolic health through a controlled dietary intervention study in healthy human volunteers – the FADiets study. This report provides an overview of the relevant literature, discussing the impact of emulsifiers and other additives on intestinal and metabolic health, and gives an overview of the studies being undertaken as part of the MECNUT Emulsifier project. © 2019 The Authors.

		<field name="AB">Background: Microbiome modulation is a pillar intervention to treat metabolic syndrome, prestages, and cascade of related pathologies such as atherosclerosis, among others. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium probiotic strains demonstrate efficacy to reduce obesity, dyslipidemia, and improve metabolic health. Novel prebiotic substances composed with known probiotics may strongly synergize health benefits to the host. The aim of this study was to evaluate beneficial effects of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains (probiotics) if composed with nanoceria (potential prebiotic) to reduce cholesterol levels and restore gut microbiota in obese mice. Materials and Methods: Two lines of mice were used in the study: BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks, 18–24 g) and CBA mice (11–12 months, 20–26 g); experimental animals were fed by fat-enriched diet 3 weeks before the evaluation. Animals were divided into groups to test probiotic strains and nanoceria. All groups received probiotic strains orally and cerium dioxide orally or intravenously in various composition. A group of untreated animals was used as a control. Cholesterol level and gut microbiota of mice were studied. Results: Cerium dioxide nanoparticles, probiotic strain L. casei ІМV В-7280, and composition B. animalis VKB/B. animalis VKL applied separately and in different combinations all reduced at different levels free and bound cholesterol in blood serum of mice fed by fat-enriched diet. The combination of 0.01 M nanoceria and probiotic strain L. casei ІМV В-7280 resulted in the fastest cholesterol level decrease in both young and mature animals. Oral administration of CeO2 applied alone reduced the number of microscopic fungi in the gut of mice and Gram-positive cocci (staphylococci and/or streptococci). Application of L. casei IMV B-7280 as a probiotic strain increased most significantly the number of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in the gut of mice. The most significant normalization of gut microbiota was observed after oral administration of alternatively either L. casei IMV B-7280 + 0.1 M CeO2 or L. casei IMV B-7280 + 0.01 M CeO2. Conclusion: Dietary application of nanoceria combined with probiotic strains L. casei IMV B-7280, B. animalis VKB, and B. animals VKL has significantly reduced both free and bound cholesterol levels in serum. Simultaneous administration of probiotics and cerium nanoparticles as a prebiotic, in various combinations, significantly enhanced positive individual effects of them on the gut microbiota spectrum. The presented results provide novel insights into mechanisms behind nutritional supplements and open new perspectives for application of probiotics combined with substances demonstrating prebiotic qualities benefiting, therefore, the host health. Follow-up translational measures are discussed to bring new knowledge from lab to the patient. If validated in a large-scale clinical study, this approach might be instrumental for primary and secondary prevention in obese individual and patients diagnosed with diabetes. To this end, individualized prediction and treatments tailored to the person are strongly recommended to benefit the health condition of affected individuals. © 2019, European Association for Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (EPMA).</field>

		<field name="AB">Gut microbiota positively contribute to livestock nutrition and metabolism. The manipulation of these microbes may improve animal health. Some feed additives improve livestock health and metabolism by regulating gut microbiota composition and activity. We fed hybrid pigs diets supplemented with 0% (control), 5% (treat 1), 10% (treat 2), or 15% (treat 3) fermented Mao-tai lees (FML) for 90 days. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bioamines, and microbial communities found in colonic contents were analyzed to investigate microbiota composition and metabolic profiles. Concentrations of straight-chain fatty acids (e.g., acetate, propionate, and butyrate) and tyramine increased with FML supplementation content. Contrary to the minor effects of 5% and 10% FML on gut microbiota, 15% FML influenced beta diversity (Jaccard or Bray–Curtis dissimilarity) but not alpha diversity (number of operational taxonomic units and Shannon diversity) of pig gut microbial communities compared to the control group. Notably, 15% FML animals were characterized by a higher abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus and Akkermansia) but lower abundances of potential pathogens (Escherichia). Numerous genes associated with metabolism (e.g., starch, sucrose, and sulfur-compounds metabolism) showed a higher relative abundance in the 15% FML than in the control group. Additionally, most Phascolarctobacterium, Treponema, Prevotella, and Faecalibacterium bacterial markers in the 15% FML group were positively correlated with straight-chain fatty acid concentrations, suggesting that these bacteria are likely associated with SCFA production. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the beneficial effects of 15% FML on fermentation of undigested compounds and gut microbiota composition in the colon. Thus, 15% FML supplementation in pig feed may possibly represent a way to optimize pig colon health for livestock farming. © 2019, The Author(s).</field>

		<field name="AB">The impact of dietary composition and prebiotics, in promoting the growth of beneficial groups of gut bacteria, is increasingly apparent. Using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, this study has aimed to characterize and compare the establishment of the gastrointestinal microbiota in dairy calves given two different commercial milk replacer (MR) diets. MR1 and MR2 contain different levels of macronutrients such as protein and fat. Moreover, differences in manufacturing methods infer that MR2 may contain a greater proportion of conjugated milk oligosaccharides (OS), while MR1 contains more free milk OS. A total of 10 dairy calves, five in each group, were assigned to one of the two MR diets. Freshly voided fecal samples were taken at 0, 7, 14, 28, and 49 days after first consumption of milk replacer. The relative abundance of two individual Bifidobacterium species, which are known to utilize milk OS, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly higher at day 7 in the fecal microbiome of calves fed MR2 compared with MR1. These commensal bacteria are widely regarded as probiotic organisms that confer a health benefit on the host. Our findings suggest that the composition of bovine milk replacers can have significant effects on the establishment of the gut microbiota in pre-weaned (neonatal) dairy calves. Better understanding of milk composition-microbiota-host interactions in early life will inform targeted interventions to increase growth and reduce mortality in young animals. © Copyright © 2019 Badman, Daly, Kelly, Moran, Cameron, Watson, Newbold and Shirazi-Beechey.</field>

		<field name="AB">The worldwide incidence of many immune-mediated and metabolic diseases, initially affecting only the wealthy Western countries, is increasing rapidly. Many of these diseases are associated with the compositional and functional alterations of gut microbiota, i.e., dysbiosis. The most consistent markers of the dysbiosis are a decrease in microbiota diversity and an expansion of Proteobacteria. The role of food preservatives as potential triggers of gut microbiota dysbiosis has been long overlooked. Using a human microbiota-associated mouse model, we demonstrate that a mixture of common antimicrobial food additives induces dysbiosis characterised by an overgrowth of Proteobacteria phylum and a decrease in the Clostridiales order. Remarkably, human gut microbiota in a Nod2-deficient genetic background is even more susceptible to the induction of Proteobacteria dysbiosis by additives than the microbiota in a wild-type background. To conclude, our data demonstrate that antimicrobial food additives trigger gut microbiota dysbiosis in both wild-type and Nod2-deficient backgrounds and at the exposure levels reached in European populations. Whether this additive-modified gut microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated and metabolic diseases remains to be elucidated. © 2019 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">Prebiotics are substrates intended to sculpt gut microbial communities as they are selectively utilized by the microorganisms to exert beneficial health effects on hosts. Macroalga-derived oligosaccharides are candidate prebiotics, and herein, we determined the effects of Laminaria sp.-derived alginate oligosaccharide (AlgOS) on the distal intestinal microbiota of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Using a high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing technique, we investigated the microbiota harbored in the intestinal content and mucus of the fish offered feeds supplemented with 0.5 and 2.5% AlgOS. We found that the prebiotic shifts the intestinal microbiota profile; alpha diversity was significantly reduced with 2.5% AlgOS while with 0.5% AlgOS the alteration occurred without impacting the bacterial diversity. Beta diversity analysis indicated the significant differences between control and prebiotic-fed groups. The low supplementation level of AlgOS facilitated the dominance of Proteobacteria (including Photobacterium phosphoreum, Aquabacterium parvum, Achromobacter insolitus), and Spirochaetes (Brevinema andersonii) in the content or mucus of the fish, and few of these bacteria (Aliivibrio logei, A. parvum, B. andersonii, A. insolitus) have genes associated with butyrate production. The results indicate that the low inclusion of AlgOS can plausibly induce a prebiotic effect on the distal intestinal microbiota of Atlantic salmon. These findings can generate further interest in the potential of macroalgae-derived oligosaccharides for food and feed applications. © Copyright © 2019 Gupta, Lokesh, Abdelhafiz, Siriyappagouder, Pierre, Sørensen, Fernandes and Kiron.</field>

		<field name="AB">The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases steadily worldwide. There is an urgent need for effective and safe IBD therapies. Accelerated resolution of inflammation is a new strategy for the management of inflammatory diseases. For effective and safe IBD treatment, herein a smart nanotherapy (i.e. oxidation-responsive nanoparticles containing a proresolving annexin A1-mimetic peptide Ac2-26, defined as AON) is developed, which can release packaged Ac2-26, in response to highly expressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) at diseased sites. AON effectively protects Ac2-26 from degradation in the enzyme-rich environment of the gastrointestinal tract. By delivering this nanotherapy to the inflamed colons of mice with IBD, site-specific release and accumulation of Ac2-26 in response to high levels of ROS at the inflammatory sites are achieved. Mechanistically, the Ac2-26-containing, oxidation-labile nanotherapy AON effectively decreases the expression of proinflammatory mediators, attenuates trafficking and infiltration of inflammatory cells, promotes efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils, and increases phenotypic switching of macrophages. Therapeutically, AON reduces symptoms of inflammation, accelerates intestinal mucosal wound healing, reshapes the gut microbiota composition, and increases short-chain fatty acid production. Additionally, oral delivery of this nanomedicine shows excellent safety profile in a mouse model, conferring the confidence for further development of a targeted precision therapy for IBD and other inflammatory diseases. © 2019 The Authors.

		<field name="AB">The presence of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) in food is very important, as most of these LAB have beneficial effects in human body, so most LAB are generally potential as probiotics. This study aims to determine the quality of frozen soyghurt/synbiotic ice cream with the addition of whipping cream. Synbiotics is an ingredient and foods that contain both probiotics and prebiotics that beneficially affects the host by improving the survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplement in the gastro intestinal tract. Prebiotics is a non-digestible food ingredient such as oligosaccharides substrates that match the enzymatic glycosidies hydrolase capacity of health promotion bacteria, that elicits the selective stimulation of growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of microbial genus/species in the gut microbiota that convers health benefits to the host. Soyghurt is one of the ingredients that includes synbiotics. This study began by making a synbiotic drink/soyghurt by inoculating Streptococcus thermophillus and probiotics isolated from okara is Lactobacillus plantarum SRCM 1 004 34 strain into a mixture of cow's milk and soy milk containing prebiotic, and then freezing it so that it is expected to produce a healthy Synbiotic Ice cream. This research was conducted experimentally using Completely Randomized Design with 4 treatments and 5 replications. The treatment is the addition of whipping cream with Soyghurt with the ratio: A = Whipping cream:Soyghurt (10:90), B = Whippy cream:Soyghurt (20:80) C = Whippy cream:Soyghurt (30:70) and D = Whippy cream:Soyghurt (40:60). The variable was observed the quality of frozen soyghurt that consisted of protein and fat content, pH, Lactic Acid Bacteria count, overrun, melting point and sensoryc evaluation. The result of the research indicated that the adding of whipping cream in frozen soyghurt making was significantly increased fat content, pH, overrun, melting point, texture and decreased protein content, Lactic Acid Bacteria count and flavour of frozen soyghurt. The conclusion is the addition of whipping cream up to 40% (D) has produce frozen soyghurt with good quality yet. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.</field>

		<field name="AB">Datasets presented here were employed in the main work “Characterization of phthalate-degrading-bacteria from Asian carp microbiomes and riverine sediments” (Kolb et al., 2019a). The carcinogenic compounds dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) are ubiquitous in the environment due to widespread production and distribution which can be taken up by aquatic organisms. Asian carp species silver (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) are exposed to phthalates by ingestion and absorption. This article presents data on the characterization of phthalate-degrading bacteria isolated from Asian carp microbiomes and riverine sediments by means of sample collection, enrichment, and isolation. Graphical data presents substrate utilization profiles of consortium SK-1 and Rhodococcus ruber derived from the gut microbiome of H. molitrix. Additionally, phthalate-degrading microbes were isolated from the gut and scale microbiomes of Asian carp where scanning electron microscopy images show the morphology from samples of final enrichment cultures and isolates. Consortium SK-1 was subjected to amplicon sequencing where community data shows the distribution of taxa while enriched with 500 mg L−1 DMP, DEP, and DBP combined. The data presented can provide insights to future research since other phthalate-degrading isolates and consortia can potentially be isolated from the microbiomes of aquatic organisms. © 2019</field>

A correction has been made to the Materials and Methods section, subsection E171 Characterization, Size and Morphology: “Food grade TiO2 was purchased from All Color Supplies PTY. Average hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index and zeta potential of the TiO2 nanoparticles dispersed in drinking water were determined with a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS at 25◦ C. The dispersion was measured 3 times for both size and zeta potential. The size distribution and shape of the TiO2 nanoparticles dispersed in mice drinking water were determined using a NanoSight NS300 (equipped with a sCMOS camera) at 25◦ C. The dispersion was measured 5 times (1 min per measurement). The size distribution and shape of the TiO2 nanoparticles dispersed in drinking water were further investigated using a Zeiss Ultra Plus scanning electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. A drop of the nanoparticle dispersion was allowed to dry on a stub, after which ∼20 Å of platinum metal was sputter coated onto the stub under vacuum to prevent charging.” The authors apologize for this error and state that this does not change the scientific conclusions of the article in any way.

		<field name="AB">The interaction between gut microbiota and host plays a central role in health. Dysbiosis, detrimental changes in gut microbiota and inflammation have been reported in non-communicable diseases. While diet has a profound impact on gut microbiota composition and function, the role of food additives such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), prevalent in processed food, is less established. In this project, we investigated the impact of food grade TiO2 on gut microbiota of mice when orally administered via drinking water. While TiO2 had minimal impact on the composition of the microbiota in the small intestine and colon, we found that TiO2 treatment could alter the release of bacterial metabolites in vivo and affect the spatial distribution of commensal bacteria in vitro by promoting biofilm formation. We also found reduced expression of the colonic mucin 2 gene, a key component of the intestinal mucus layer, and increased expression of the beta defensin gene, indicating that TiO2 significantly impacts gut homeostasis. These changes were associated with colonic inflammation, as shown by decreased crypt length, infiltration of CD8+ T cells, increased macrophages as well as increased expression of inflammatory cytokines. These findings collectively show that TiO2 is not inert, but rather impairs gut homeostasis which may in turn prime the host for disease development. © 2019 Pinget, Tan, Janac, Kaakoush, Angelatos, O'Sullivan, Koay, Sierro, Davis, Divakarla, Khanal, Moore, Stanley, Chrzanowski and Macia.</field>

		<field name="AB">Although lifestyle and physiology in obese individuals are accepted to lead to changes in the intestinal microbiota, uncertainty remains about microbiota dysbiosis, and xenobiotics intake, as a source of selective pressure, independent of antimicrobial chemotherapy. The aimof this studywas to compare the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance geneticmarkers (ARG) infaecal specimens of eutrophic, overweight and obese individuals, and their correlation with xenobiotic intake and gut bacteria density. Methods: Thiswas a cross-sectional case-controlled study including 72 adult participantswith no record of intestinal or systemic diseases, or recent use of antimicrobials, grouped as eutrophic, overweight, or obese. Anthropometric profile, eating habits and oral xenobiotics intake were recorded. Faecal metagenomic DNA was used to screen for ARG by PCR, and to measure bacterial groups by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Student’s t andWilcoxon testswere used to comparemeans and differences inARG detection (95%confidence intervals). Correlation analyses (odds ratio) and relationships between bacteria density and ARG were determined. Results: Increase in abdominal circumference, waist circumference, hip, waist-hip ratio, BMI, carbohydrate, fibres, and total calorie intakes were different from eutrophic to obese participants. Habitual use of antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory drugs, antacids, and artificial sweeteners were associated mainly with obesity and overweight. Nutritional supplements were associated to the eutrophic group. ARG screening showed differences being more frequent among obese, and positive for 27 genetic markers related to β-lactams, tetracyclines, the macrolide lincosamide and streptogramin group, quinolones, sulfonamides, aminoglycosides, and efflux pump. Positive correlation between ARG and BMI, caloric intake, and intake of xenobiotics, was observed for obese individuals. Relationships among ARG detection and bacteria densities were also different. Conclusions: This study reinforces the hypothesis that obese individuals may harbour an altered gut microbiota, if compared to eutrophic. The overweight individuals display a transitional gut microbiota which seems to be between eutrophic and obese. Furthermore, the increased xenobiotic intake associated to obesity may play an important role in the antimicrobial resistance phenomenon. © 2019 by the authors.

		<field name="AB">The relationship between animals and their gut flora is simultaneously one of the most common and most complex symbioses on Earth. Despite its ubiquity, our understanding of this invisible but often critical relationship is still in its infancy. We employed adult Neotropical butterflies as a study system to ask three questions: First, how does gut microbial community composition vary across host individuals, species and dietary guilds? Second, how do gut microbiota compare to food microbial communities? Finally, are gut flora functionally adapted to the chemical makeup of host foods? To answer these questions we captured nearly 300 Costa Rican butterflies representing over 50 species, six families, and two feeding guilds: frugivores and nectivores. We characterized bacteria and fungi in guts, wild fruits, and wild nectars via amplicon sequencing and assessed the catabolic abilities of the gut microbiota via culture-based assays. Gut communities were distinct from food communities, suggesting that the gut environment acts as a filter on potential colonists. Nevertheless, gut flora varied widely among individuals and species. On average, a pair of butterflies shared 21% of their bacterial species and 6% of their fungi. Host species explained 25–30% of variation in microbial communities while host diet explained 4%, suggesting that non-dietary aspects of host biology play a large role in structuring the butterfly gut flora. Much of the variation between species correlated with host phylogeny. Host diet was related to gut microbial function: compared to frugivores, nectivores’ gut flora exhibited increased catabolism of sugars and sugar alcohols and decreased catabolism of amino acids, carboxylic acids, and dicarboxylic acids. Since fermented juice contains more amino acids and less sugar than nectar, it appears that host diet filters the gut flora by favoring microbes that digest compounds abundant in foods. By quantifying the degree to which gut communities vary among host individuals, species and dietary guilds and evaluating how gut microbial composition and catabolic potential are related to host diet, this study highlights the linkages between structure and function in one of the most complex and ubiquitous symbioses in the animal kingdom. © 2019 The Authors.

		<field name="AB">Human gut bacterial Na(+)-transporting NADH:ubiquinone reductase (NQR) sequence is associated with Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, Alzheimer disease-associated sequence (ADAS) is further characterized in cultured spore-forming Clostridium sp. Tryptophan and NQR substrate ubiquinone have common precursor chorismate in microbial shikimate pathway. Tryptophan-derived tryptamine presents in human diet and gut microbiome. Tryptamine inhibits tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) with consequent neurodegeneration in cell and animal models. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase inhibition causes protein biosynthesis impairment similar to that revealed in AD. Tryptamine-induced TrpRS gene-dose reduction is associated with TrpRS protein deficiency and cell death. In animals, tryptamine treatment results in toxicity, weight gain, and prediabetes-related hypoglycemia. Sequence analysis of gut microbiome database reveals 89% to 100% ADAS nucleotide identity in American Indian (Cheyenne and Arapaho [C&amp;A]) Oklahomans, of which ~93% being overweight or obese and 50% self-reporting type 2 diabetes (T2D). Alzheimer disease-associated sequence occurs in 10.8% of C&amp;A vs 1.3% of healthy American population. This observation is of considerable interest because T2D links to AD and obesity. Alzheimer disease-associated sequence prevails in gut microbiome of colorectal cancer, which linked to AD. Metabolomics revealed that tryptamine, chorismate precursor quinate, and chorismate product 4-hydroxybenzoate (ubiquinone precursor) are significantly higher, while tryptophan-containing dipeptides are lower due to tRNA aminoacylation deficiency in C&amp;A compared with non-native Oklahoman who showed no ADAS. Thus, gut microbial tryptamine overproduction correlates with ADAS occurrence. Antibiotic and diet additives induce ADAS and tryptamine. Mitogenic/cytotoxic tryptamine cause microbial and human cell death, gut dysbiosis, and consequent disruption of host-microbe homeostasis. Present analysis of 1246 participants from 17 human gut metagenomics studies revealed ADAS in cell death diseases. © The Author(s) 2019.</field>

		<field name="AB">Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Because of the use of first-line CRC treatments, such as irinotecan (IRI), is hindered by dose-limiting side effects, improved drug delivery systems may have major clinical benefits for CRC treatment. In this study, we generate and characterize liposomal irinotecan (Lipo-IRI), a lipid-based nanoparticle, which shows excellent bioavailability and pharmacokinetics. Additionally, this formulation allows IRI to be maintained in active form and prolongs its half-life in circulation compared to IRI in solution. Compared with IRI statistically, the level of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in colonic tissue decreases, and Bifidobacterium spp. (beneficial intestinal microbiota) content increases in the Lipo-IRI-treated group. Moreover, no damage is observed by the hematoxylin and eosin staining of the normal tissue samples from the Lipo-IRI-treated group. In a xenograft mouse model, CRC tumors shrink markedly following Lipo-IRI treatment, and mice receiving a targeted combination of Lipo-IRI and liposomal doxorubicin (Lipo-Dox) extend their survival rate significantly. Overall, our results demonstrate that this formulation of Lipo-IRI shows a great potential for the treatment of colorectal cancer. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</field>

		<field name="AB">Objective: Parkin is the causative gene for autosomal recessive familial Parkinson's disease (PD), although it remains unclear how parkin dysfunction is involved with the general condition. Recently, serum and/or plasma metabolomics revealed alterations in metabolic pathways that might reflect pathomechanisms of idiopathic PD (iPD). Thus, we hypothesized that serum metabolomics of patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous parkin mutations (namely, PARK2) might reflect metabolic alterations due to parkin dysfunction. Methods: We enrolled 15 PARK2 patients (52 ± 17.6 years) confirmed with homozygous (seven cases) and compound heterozygous (eight cases) parkin mutations, along with 19 healthy age-matched controls (51 ± 11.5 years). We analyzed 830 metabolites from participants’ serum using well-established metabolomics technologies, including ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectroscopy. Results: Based on metabolic profiles, hierarchical matrix analysis can divide samples between control and PARK2 subjects. Profiles from PARK2 patients showed significantly higher levels of fatty acid (FA) metabolites and oxidized lipids, and significantly lower levels of antioxidant, caffeine, and benzoate-related metabolites. Interpretation: Metabolomics can identify specific metabolic alterations in PARK2 patients compared with controls. Alterations in FA metabolites suggest a relationship between parkin function and lipid metabolism. The elevation of oxidized lipids in combination with decreasing antioxidants may reflect general hyperoxidative stress. Decreasing benzoate-related metabolites might be due to the alteration in gut microbiota. Consequently, caffeine and its metabolites may be decreased due to malabsorption. These findings are similar to metabolic alterations in iPD. Thus, serum/plasma metabolomics may reflect the association between parkin dysfunction and parkinsonism. © 2019 The Authors.

		<field name="AB">Background: Poultry meat has high contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids that can cause off-flavors, off-odors, and reduce meat quality and shelf life. Replacement of phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) with chemical additives are highly considered, which reduces the potential risk of using poultry meat. Objectives: The current study aimed at determining the effects of hydroalcoholic extract of hogweed (Heracleum persicum) and anise (Pimpinella anisum L.) on broiler meat quality, immune responses, and intestinal microflora and morphology. Methods: The current study was conducted on 400 male Ross 308 chickens divided into five treatment groups, based on a completely randomized design with four replicates of 20 broilers. The control group was not fed any feed additives, whereas the other groups received 100 mg/kg of probiotics (Primalac®), 200 mg/kg of hogweed extract, 200 mg/kg of anise extract, and 200 mg/kg of oxytetracycline, respectively. On day 35 of chicken breeding, the immune responses were investigated. At the end of chicken breeding, meat quality was analyzed. Also, the jejunal and ileal contents were investigated in terms of intestinal morphology and microflora. Results: The findings indicated that the highest immune response belonged to the anise extract treatment. The best meat quality belonged to treatments with hogweed and anise extracts (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Also, the lowest number of harmful intestinal bacteria belonged to hogweed extract treatment (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Morphological characteristics of the intestine improved under the effects of hogweed and anise extract treatments (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions: Therefore, inclusion of 200 mg/kg of hogweed and anise extracts in broiler diet is suggested to improve meat quality, immune responses, and intestinal morphology as well as reduce the number of harmful bacteria in the ileum.

		<field name="AB">Both nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners may influence energy and glucose metabolism differently. The hypothesis that sucrose, fructose, aspartame, and sucralose intake differently modulate energy and glucose metabolism was tested in an estrogen-deficient animal model. At 30 min after giving aspartame and sucralose (10 mg/kg body weight), an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted with glucose, sucrose, and fructose in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. After OGTT, they were continuously fed high fat diets including either 10% corn starch (Control), 10% sucrose (Sucrose), 10% fructose (Fructose), 0.05% aspartame + 9.95% starch (Aspar- tame) or 0.05% sucralose + 9.95% starch (Sucralose) for 8 week. During 30 min after acute administration of aspartame and sucralose, serum glucose concentrations increased despite slightly increased serum insulin levels before glucose infusion. However, glucose tolerance was not significantly different among the groups. In chronic study, serum glucose concentrations were lowest and insulin highest at the overnight-fasted state in Aspar- tame and Sucralose. Postprandial serum glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and insulin levels were higher in Aspartame and Sucralose than Control. Hepatic insulin signaling (pAkt → pGSK-3β) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) expression were lower in Sucralose and Aspartame than the Fructose. Serum acetate levels produced by gut microbiota were higher were lower in the fructose group than Aspartame and Sucralose groups. In conclu- sion, aspartame and sucralose with a meal might be preferable sweeteners to fructose and sucrose in estrogen deficient rats, and possibly post-menopausal women; however, this needs to be confirmed in human studies. © 2019 JCBN.</field>

		<field name="AB">Nowadays, issues of mineral nutrition of humans and animals are quite relevant. High-energy rations, multicomponent feed mixtures and additives in the diets require special attention when optimizing limited microelements. A priori, chromium, being an important trace element in animals, is used to correct carbohydrate, fat and lipid metabolism. Due to its low content in the components of diets, its role in the formation of the microecological status of the body is poorly understood. At the same time, its biological availability in the body depends on the source of chromium. In the present work, using a model object, the Wistar rats, we for the first time compared the biological effects of various chromium sources, i.e. picolinate (CrPic), nanoform (NP Cr2O3) and chloride (CrCl3) at doses of 300 and 500 μg/kg feed, according to a set of indicators (feed digestibility, hematological parameters, activity of digestive enzymes, composition of intestinal microflora) and established greater bioavailability and more pronounced positive effect of picolinate and chromium nanoparticles on body weight and hematological parameters and ambiguous influence of the studied forms on the activity of digestive enzymes and intestinal microflora. The purpose of this work was to study the biological effect of chromium in various forms and dosages on Wistar rats. The studies were carried out on 105 white male rats weighing 70-80 g under standard vivarium conditions (Federal Scientific Center for Biological Systems and Agrotechnologies of the Russian Academy of Sciences). Animals were divided into seven groups (n = 15 each). The control group was fed a common diet. The group I diet included Cr2O3 NPs at a dose of 300 µg/kg feed (NP 300), group II — CrCl3 at a dose of 300 mg/kg (CrCl3 300), group III — chromium picolinate (CrPic) at a dose of 300 mg/kg (CrPic 300), group IV — Cr2O3 NPs at a dose of 500 µg/kg of feed (NP 500), group V — CrCl3 at a dose of 500 mg/kg (CrCl3 500), and group VI — CrPic at a dose of 500 mg/kg (CrPic 500). Nanoparticles were introduced into the feed by mixing. The introduction of chromium in the form of CrPic and Cr2O3 NPs at a dose of 500 μg/kg, under the same feed consumption, was accompanied by an increase in the body weight of rats by 22.6 and 22.2 % (p ≤ 0.05). The effect of Cr2O3 NPs expressed as the absence of the reaction of lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes, in other cases their level exceeded control values by 14 to 45 %. Synthesis of hemoglobin was adequate to stimulation of erythropoiesis, but an increase in the number of platelets resulted in blood sludging, an increase in viscosity and difficulty in perfusion through vessels. This symptom was typical for NP Cr2O3 300, CrCl3 300 and CrCl3 500 (the difference with the control is from 70 to 90 %, p 0.05). High digestibility of CrPic and NPs Cr2O3 500 (from 20.2 to 34.0 %), accompanied by manifestation of hepato- and nephrotoxicity, with signs of oxidative stress, decreased activity of amylase and lipase in the blood plasma, indicating a depressant effect of high doses of chromium on enteropancreatic circulation of the digestive enzymes and metabolic disorders of Mg and Fe in the blood. Triglycerides, like true fats, decreased at maximum doses of chromium in the form of chloride and picolinate, confirming their participation in lipid metabolism, causing splitting of excess fat in the body, and reducing the ratio of fat to body weight ratio from 2 (control group) to 0.82 (NP Cr2O3 500). The indicators of bilirubin and creatinine clearly demonstrate the absence of toxicity at low doses, i.e. Cr2O3 NPs 300 and CrPic 300. Amylase activity in the pancreas is increased at a dose of 300 µg/kg of Cr2O3 NPs. Dietary CrPic in a similar dosage stimulated the activity of lipase and protease, whereas in the 12 duodenal ulcer it led to a decrease in the activity of amylase and lipase. CrCl3 and CrPic at a dosage of 500 µg/kg reduced the activity of lipase in the duodenum. The specific effect of Cr NPs 500 µg/kg on the microecological status of the organism was manifested in a decrease in the number of lactic acid bacteria by 55.9 %. The number of bifidobacteria was significantly higher, by 48.6 % (p 0.05), in the PicCr 500-fed group. The number of enterobacteria in the NP 300-fed group was 34.8 % lower than the control, while in the other groups their number increased 24.0-33.7 times (р 0.05). From the totality of the estimated parameters of the intestinal microflora, the use of nanoparticles in the composition of the diet is promising due to the lack of resistance. Thus, chromium of CrPic 500, NP Cr2O3 300 does not show a toxic effect on the body, and has a stimulating effect on growth, development, digestibility of chromium, the activity of the digestive enzymes and microecological status of the organism, which puts these forms in the category of promising sources of chromium for the correction of metabolism and the microbial composition of the gastrointestinal tract of animals. © 2019 Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

		<field name="AB">A wide range of chronic diseases is associated with sugar consumption: Caries, obesity, metabolic syndrome with impaired glucose tolerance and / or diabetes, elevated blood, lipids arterial, hypertension, hepatic steatosis and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There is an urgent need to reduce sugar consumption. Sugar surrogates may help achieving this goal. However, artificial sweeteners seem to be associated with adverse metabolic effects such as insulin resistance, obesity, and altered gut microbiota composition. Naturally occurring sweeteners such as xylitol, erythritol and rare sugars are possibly more favorable, but have to be studied in detail. © 2019 Hogrefe</field>

		<field name="AB">Graphene oxide (GO) has been extensively used in various critical fields such as biomedicine, while its antibacterial properties and potential toxicities raised serious concerns in recent years. The impacts of GO on the intestinal microbiota and associated immune responses in the host are still ambiguous. In this study, we investigated the effects of GO chronic exposure (25 days) on the composition of the intestinal microbiota and immune response in female &amp;amp; male zebrafish at different concentrations (0.05, 0.5, and 5 mg L-1). Results demonstrated that the diversity and richness of the bacterial community at the phylum and genus levels significantly differed in the presence of GO between female and male zebrafish. The in vitro assay verified the effect of acute toxicity of GO on the survival ability of bacterial strains isolated from zebrafish intestines, albeit no changes in the bacterial metabolic functions were observed. Further, exposure to GO significantly altered the length and width of villi in the anterior intestines, caused abnormalities of the ultra-micro structure, and increased the number of inflammation-related cells detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Moreover, the elevated expression levels of crucial pro-inflammatory genes, such as tnf-α, ifn-γ, nf-κb, tlr-5, il-1β, and il-8, were significantly induced, while the expression levels of anti-inflammatory genes, such as il-4 and il-13, were inhibited, especially in male zebrafish. Taken all together, chronic exposure to GO disturbed the diversity and richness of intestinal microbes, increased the pathogenic bacterial community in zebrafish, induced damage to the gut tissues, and activated the inflammation response. These findings provided new insights into GO effects on the inflammation and intestinal microbiota in the host, which is closely linked with metabolisms and physiological activities in biological systems. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.</field>

		<field name="AB">Non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) are marketed as sugar alternatives providing sweet taste with few or no calories. Yet their consumption has been linked to metabolic dysfunction and changes in the gut microbiome. NNS exposure mostly originates from diet beverages and sweetener packages in adults or breastmilk in infants. Consequences of early life exposure remain largely unknown. We exposed pregnant and lactating mice to NNS (sucralose, acesulfame-K) at doses relevant for human consumption. While the pups' exposure was low, metabolic changes were drastic, indicating extensive downregulation of hepatic detoxification mechanisms and changes in bacterial metabolites. Microbiome profiling confirmed a significant increase in firmicutes and a striking decrease of Akkermansia muciniphila. Similar microbiome alterations in humans have been linked to metabolic disease and obesity. While our findings need to be reproduced in humans, they suggest that NNS consumption during pregnancy and lactation may have adverse effects on infant metabolism.

		<field name="AB">The human microbiome has been associated with health status, and risk of disease development. While the etiology of microbiome-mediated disease remains to be fully elucidated, one mechanism may be through microbial metabolism. Metabolites produced by commensal organisms, including in response to host diet, may affect host metabolic processes, with potentially protective or pathogenic consequences. We conducted multi-omic phenotyping of healthy subjects (N = 136), in order to investigate the interaction between diet, the microbiome, and the metabolome in a cross-sectional sample. We analyzed the nutrient composition of self-reported diet (3-day food records and food frequency questionnaires). We profiled the gut and oral microbiome (16S rRNA) from stool and saliva, and applied metabolomic profiling to plasma and stool samples in a subset of individuals (N = 75). We analyzed these multi-omic data to investigate the relationship between diet, the microbiome, and the gut and circulating metabolome. On a global level, we observed significant relationships, particularly between long-term diet, the gut microbiome and the metabolome. Intake of plant-derived nutrients as well as consumption of artificial sweeteners were associated with significant differences in circulating metabolites, particularly bile acids, which were dependent on gut enterotype, indicating that microbiome composition mediates the effect of diet on host physiology. Our analysis identifies dietary compounds and phytochemicals that may modulate bacterial abundance within the gut and interact with microbiome composition to alter host metabolism.

		<field name="AB">Paeoniflorin, the main component of Xiaoyao Wan, presents low oral bioavailability and unclear antidepressant mechanism. To elucidate the potential reasons for the low bioavailability of paeoniflorin and explore its antidepressant mechanism from the perspective of the gut microbiota, here, a chronic unpredictable depression model and forced swimming test were firstly performed to examine the antidepressant effects of paeoniflorin. Then the pharmacokinetic study of paeoniflorin in rats was performed based on the gut microbiota; meanwhile, the gut microbiota incubated with paeoniflorin in vitro was used to identify the possible metabolites of paeoniflorin. Molecular virtual docking experiments together with the specific inhibitor tests were applied to investigate the mechanism of paeoniflorin metabolism by the gut microbiota. Finally, the intestinal microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. The pharmacodynamics tests showed that paeoniflorin had significant antidepressant activity, but its oral bioavailability was 2.32%. Interestingly, we found paeoniflorin was converted into benzoic acid by the gut microbiota, and was mainly excreted through the urine with the gut metabolite benzoic acid as the prominent excreted form. Moreover, paeoniflorin could also regulate the composition of the gut microbiota by increasing the abundance of probiotics. Therefore, the metabolism effect of gut microbiota may be one of the main reasons for the low oral bioavailability of paeoniflorin. Additionally, paeoniflorin can be metabolized into benzoic acid via gut microbiota enzymes, which might exert antidepressant effects through the blood-brain barrier into the brain. © 2019 Yu, Zhao, Peng, Pan, Fu, Ma, Han, Cong, Zhang, Sun, Jiang and Wang.</field>

		<field name="AB">Pectins are plant cell-wall polysaccharides which can be utilized by commensal bacteria in the gut, exhibiting beneficial properties for the host. Knowledge of the impact of pectins on intestinal bacterial communities is insufficient and limited to a few types of pectins. This study characterized the relationship between the structural properties of pectins and their potential to modulate composition and activity of the gut microbiota in a beneficial way. For this purpose we performed in vitro fermentations of nine structurally diverse pectins from citrus fruits and sugar beet, and a pectic derivative, rhamnogalacturonan I (RGI), using a TIM-2 colon model. The composition of microbiota during TIM-2 fermentations was assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Both general and pectin-specific changes were observed in relative abundances of numerous bacterial taxa in a time-dependent way. Bacterial populations associated with human health, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus, Dorea, Blautia, Oscillospira, Sutterella, Bifidobacterium, Christensenellaceae, Prevotella copri, and Bacteroides spp. were either increased or decreased depending on the substrate, suggesting that these bacteria can be controlled using structurally different pectins. The main structural features linked to the pectin-mediated shifts in microbiota included degree of esterification, composition of neutral sugars, distribution of homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan fractions, degree of branching, and the presence of amide groups. Cumulative production of the total short chain fatty acids and propionate was largest in fermentations of the high methoxyl pectins. Thus, this study indicates that microbial communities in the gut can be specifically modulated by pectins and identifies the features in pectin molecules linked to microbial alterations. This knowledge can be used to define preferred dietary pectins, targeting beneficial bacteria, and favoring more balanced microbiota communities in the gut. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

		<field name="AB">The objective of this study was to examine the effects of Jackyakgamcho-Tang (JGT) on acute colitis. GC/MS-based metabolomics and NGS-based metagenomics were applied to investigate the alteration of metabolites and microbiota in an acute colitis model. The severity of acute colitis symptoms was alleviated by JGT treatment. Induction of colitis and JGT treatment changed compositions of gut microbiota and inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-α and IL-6). They also substantially change metabolites (i.e., lactic acid, linoleic acid, monostearin, and palmitoylglycerol). In addition, some clear correlations were observed among metabolites, cytokine, and microbiota.

		<field name="AB">Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 NPs) were used worldwide for decades, and pregnant women are unable to avoid exposing to them. Studies revealed that TiO 2 NPs could kill many kinds of bacteria, but whether they would affect the composition of gut microbiota, especially during pregnancy, was seldom reported. And, what adverse effects may be brought to pregnant females was also unknown. In this study, we established the prenatal exposure model of rats to explore the effects of TiO 2 NPs on gut microbiota. We observed an increasing trend, but not a significant change of alpha-diversity among control and exposure groups at gestation day (GD) 10 and GD 17 during normal pregnancy process. Each different time point had unique gut microbiota operational taxonomic units (OTUs) characteristics. The abundance of Ellin6075 decreased at GD 10 and GD 17, Clostridiales increased at GD 10, and Dehalobacteriaceae decreased at GD 17 after TiO 2 NPs exposure. Further phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) prediction indicated that the type 2 diabetes mellitus related genes were enhanced, and taurine metabolism was weakened at the second-trimester. Further study showed that the rats’ fasting blood glucose levels significantly increased at GD 10 (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and GD 17 (P &amp;lt; 0.01) after exposure. Our study pointed out that TiO 2 NPs induced the alteration of gut microbiota during pregnancy and increased the fasting blood glucose of pregnant rats, which might increase the potential risk of gestational diabetes of pregnant women. © 2019, The Author(s).</field>

		<field name="AB">Emulsifiers are commonly used in food processing for the technological purpose of altering the flavor or to improve the texture of foods. Due to their ubiquity, these substances are consumed daily at low levels in the human diet. Recently published in vitro and in vivo studies suggest dietary exposure to emulsifiers modulate the gut microbiota and contribute to the increasing prevalence of metabolic disease. A literature search was conducted which identified eight studies investigating the interaction of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polysorbate 80, gum arabic, carrageenan, and arabinogalactan with the gut microbiota in murine and in vitro models. Numerous inconsistent changes in various phyla and genera were identified. These studies were conducted at high doses that have no relevance to the current dietary levels consumed in the United States. Subtle changes in gut microbiota composition as a toxicological endpoint is not supported by established internationally recognized toxicology testing guidelines. Therefore, the results of these studies are difficult to interpret and extrapolate to humans and are not supported by previous safety conclusions of international food safety authorities. The current understanding of the gut microbiota is that the structure is highly dynamic and is heavily influenced by the diet. Thus, the results of these studies may not necessarily suggest a safety concern, but rather reflect an adaptive response of the gut microbiota to an external stressor. Future research will need to further elucidate the mechanisms of metabolic disease in rodents and humans and establish clinically relevant and reliable endpoints to assess changes in gut microflora. © 2018 Institute of Food Technologists®</field>

		<field name="AB">Sensing nutrients within the gastrointestinal tract engages the enteroendocrine cell system to signal within the mucosa, to intrinsic and extrinsic nerve pathways, and the circulation. This signaling provides powerful feedback from the intestine to slow the rate of gastric emptying, limit postprandial glycemic excursions, and induce satiation. This review focuses on the intestinal sensing of sweet stimuli (including low-calorie sweeteners), which engage similar G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the sweet taste receptors (STRs) of the tongue. It explores the enteroendocrine cell signals deployed upon STR activation that act within and outside the gastrointestinal tract, with a focus on the role of this distinctive pathway in regulating glucose transport function via absorptive enterocytes, and the associated impact on postprandial glycemic responses in animals and humans. The emerging role of diet, including low-calorie sweeteners, in modulating the composition of the gut microbiome and how this may impact glycemic responses of the host, is also discussed, as is recent evidence of a causal role of diet-induced dysbiosis in influencing the gut-brain axis to alter gastric emptying and insulin release. Full knowledge of intestinal STR signaling in humans, and its capacity to engage host and/or microbiome mechanisms that modify glycemic control, holds the potential for improved prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. © Copyright © 2018 Kreuch, Keating, Wu, Horowitz, Rayner and Young.</field>

		<field name="AB">The gut microbiota regulates key hepatic functions, notably through the production of bacterial metabolites that are transported via the portal circulation. We evaluated the effects of metabolites produced by the gut microbiota from aromatic amino acids (phenylacetate, benzoate, p-cresol, and indole) on liver inflammation induced by bacterial endotoxin. Precision-cut liver slices prepared from control mice, Kupffer cell (KC)-depleted mice, and obese mice (ob/ob) were treated with or without LPS and bacterial metabolites. We observed beneficial effects of indole that dose-dependently reduced the LPS-induced up-regulation of proinflammatory mediators at both mRNA and protein levels in precision-cut liver slices prepared from control or ob/ob mice. KC depletion partly prevented the antiinflammatory effects of indole, notably through a reduction of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) pathway activation. In vivo, the oral administration of indole before an LPS injection reduced the expression of key proteins of the NF-kB pathway and downstream proinflammatory gene up-regulation. Indole also prevented LPS-induced alterations of cholesterol metabolism through a transcriptional regulation associated with increased 4b-hydroxycholesterol hepatic levels. In summary, indole appears as a bacterial metabolite produced from tryptophan that is able to counteract the detrimental effects of LPS in the liver. Indole could be a new target to develop innovative strategies to decrease hepatic inflammation. © The Author(s)</field>

		<field name="AB">Pectin is a complex dietary fiber and a prebiotic. To investigate pectin-induced changes in the gut microbiome and their effects on the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production, we performed in vitro pectin fermentation using the feces of three Korean donors. The pectin degradations in all three donors were observed. While the donors displayed differences in baseline gut microbiota composition, commonly increased bacteria after pectin fermentation included Lachnospira, Dorea, Clostridium, and Sutterella. Regarding SCFAs, acetate levels rapidly increased with incubation with pectin, and butyrate levels also increased after 6 h of incubation. The results suggest that pectin fermentation increases bacterial species belonging to Clostridium cluster XIV (Lachnospira, Dorea, and Clostridium), with Lachnospira displaying the greatest increase. The results also confirm that pectin fermentation leads to the production of acetate and butyrate. © 2018, The Author(s).</field>

		<field name="AB">Background: In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), gut-derived uremic toxins play a fundamental role in the systemic inflammation and oxidative stress promoting the excess morbidity and mortality. The biochemical derangement is in part a consequence of an insufficient generation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) due to the dysbiosis of the gut and an insufficient consumption of the fermentable complex carbohydrates. Aim of the study: The primary end-point was to evaluate the potential efficacy of SCFA (specifically, sodium propionate (SP)) for patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) on systemic inflammation. Secondary end-points included potential attenuation of oxidative stress markers, insulin resistance and production of gut-derived uremic toxins indoxyl sulfate and p-cresol sulfate, as well as health status after SP supplementation. Study design: We performed a single-center non-randomized pilot study in 20 MHD patients. They received the food additive SP with a daily intake of 2 × 500 mg in the form of capsules for 12 weeks. Pre-dialysis blood samples were taken at the beginning, after six weeks and at the end of the administration period, as well as four weeks after stopping the treatment. Results: The subjects revealed a significant decline of inflammatory parameters C-reactive protein (−46%), interleukin IL-2 (−27%) and IL-17 (−15%). The inflammatory parameters IL-6 and IFN-gamma showed a mild non-significant reduction, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased significantly (+71%). While the concentration of bacterial endotoxins and TNF-α remained unchanged, the gut-derived uremic toxins, indoxyl sulfate (−30%) and p-cresyl sulfate (−50%), revealed a significant decline. The SP supplementation reduced the parameters of oxidative stress malondialdehyde (−32%) and glutathione peroxidase activity (−28%). The serum insulin levels dropped by 30% and the HOMA-index by 32%. The reduction of inflammatory parameters was associated with a lowering of ferritin and a significant increase in transferrin saturation (TSAT). Four weeks after the end of the treatment phase, all improved parameters deteriorated again. Evaluation of the psycho-physical performance with the short form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire showed an enhancement in the self-reported physical functioning, general health, vitality and mental health. The SP supplementation was well tolerated and without important side effects. No patient had left the study due to intolerance to the medication. The SP supplementation in MHD patients reduced pro-inflammatory parameters and oxidative stress and improved insulin resistance and iron metabolism. Furthermore, SP effectively lowered the important gut-derived uremic toxins indoxyl and p-cresol sulfate. These improvements were associated with a better quality of life. Further controlled studies are required in a larger cohort to evaluate the clinical outcome. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</field>

		<field name="AB">Selenium (Se) is an essential element for human and animal health. Biogenic selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) by microorganism possess unique physical and chemical properties and biological activities compared with inorganic Se and organic Se. The study was conducted to investigate the mainly biological activities of SeNPs by Lactobacillus casei ATCC 393 (L. casei 393). The results showed that L. casei 393 transformed sodium selenite to red SeNPs with the size of 50-80 nm, and accumulated them intracellularly. L. casei 393-SeNPs promoted the growth and proliferation of porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2), human colonic epithelial cells (NCM460), and human acute monocytic leukemia cell (THP-1)-derived macrophagocyte. L. casei 393-SeNPs significantly inhibited the growth of human liver tumor cell line-HepG2, and alleviated diquat-induced IPEC-J2 oxidative damage. Moreover, in vivo and in vitro experimental results showed that administration with L. casei 393-SeNPs protected against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88 (ETEC K88)-caused intestinal barrier dysfunction. ETEC K88 infection-associated oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase activity, total superoxide dismutase activity, total antioxidant capacity, and malondialdehyde) was ameliorated in L. casei 393-SeNPs-treated mice. These findings suggest that L. casei 393-SeNPs with no cytotoxicity play a key role in maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity and intestinal microflora balance in response to oxidative stress and infection. © 2018 Xu, Guo, Qiao, Ma, Cheng and Roman.</field>

		<field name="AB">There is a growing recognition of the role the gastrointestinal microbiota plays in health and disease. Ingested antimicrobial proteins and peptides have the potential to alter the gastrointestinal microbiota; particularly if protected from digestion. Nisin is an antimicrobial peptide that is used as a food preservative. This study examined the ability of nisin to affect the murine microbiota when fed to mice in two different starch based matrices; a starch dough comprising raw starch granules and a starch gel comprising starch that was gelatinized and retrograded. The effects of the two starch matrices by themselves on the microbiota were also examined. Following 16S rRNA compositional sequencing, beta diversity analysis highlighted a significant difference (p = 0.001, n = 10) in the murine microbiota between the four diet groups. The differences between the two nisin containing diets were mainly attributable to differences in the nisin release from the starch matrices while the differences between the carriers were mainly attributable to the type of resistant starch they possessed. Indeed, the differences in the relative abundance of several genera in the mice consuming the starch dough and starch gel diets, in particular Akkermansia, the relative abundance of which was 0.5 and 11.9%, respectively (p = 0.0002, n = 10), points to the potential value of resistance starch as a modulator of beneficial gut microbes. Intact nisin and nisin digestion products (in particular nisin fragment 22-31) were detected in the feces and the nisin was biologically active. However, despite a three-fold greater consumption of nisin in the group fed the nisin in starch dough diet, twice as much nisin was detected in the feces of the group which consumed the nisin in starch gel diet. In addition, the relative abundance of three times as many genera from the lower gastrointestinal tract (GIT) were significantly different (p &lt; 0.001, n = 10) to the control for the group fed the nisin in starch gel diet, implying that the starch gel afforded a degree of protection from digestion to the nisin entrapped within it. © 2018 Gough, Cabrera Rubio, O'Connor, Crispie, Brodkorb, Miao, Hill, Ross, Cotter, Nilaweera and Rea.</field>

		<field name="AB">The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of gellan gum (E 418) as a food additive. Following the conceptual framework for the risk assessment of certain food additives re-evaluated under Commission Regulation (EU) No 257/2010, the Panel considered that adequate exposure and toxicity data were available. Based on the reported use levels, a refined exposure of up to 72.4 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day in toddlers at the 95th percentile was estimated. Gellan gum is unlikely to be absorbed intact and would not be fermented by human intestinal microbiota. There is no concern with respect to carcinogenicity and genotoxicity. No adverse effects were reported in chronic studies at the highest doses tested in mice and rats (3,627 and 1,460 mg gellan gum/kg bw per day, respectively). Repeated oral intake up to 200 mg/kg bw per day for 3 weeks had no adverse effects in humans. The Panel concluded that there is no need for a numerical acceptable daily intake (ADI) for gellan gum (E 418), and that there is no safety concern at the refined exposure assessment for the reported uses and use levels of gellan gum (E 418) as a food additive. The Panel recommended to better define the specifications of gellan gum including the absence of viable cells of the microbial source and the presence of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), protein and residual bacterial enzymatic activities. © 2018 European Food Safety Authority.

		<field name="AB">Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is commonly used as a food additive (E171 in the EU) for its whitening and opacifying properties. However, a risk of intestinal barrier disruption, including dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, is increasingly suspected because of the presence of a nano-sized fraction in this additive. We hypothesized that food-grade E171 and Aeroxyde P25 (identical to the NM-105 OECD reference nanomaterial in the European Union Joint Research Centre) interact with both commensal intestinal bacteria and transient food-borne bacteria under non-UV-irradiated conditions. Based on differences in their physicochemical properties, we expect a difference in their respective effects. To test these hypotheses, we chose a panel of eight Gram-positive/Gram-negative bacterial strains, isolated from different biotopes and belonging to the species Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis and cremoris), Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactobacillus sakei. Bacterial cells were exposed to food-grade E171 vs. P25 in vitro and the interactions were explored with innovative (nano)imaging methods. The ability of bacteria to trap TiO2 was demonstrated using synchrotron UV fluorescence imaging with single cell resolution. Subsequent alterations in the growth profiles were shown, notably for the transient food-borne L. lactis and the commensal intestinal E. coli in contact with food-grade TiO2. However, for both species, the reduction in cell cultivability remained moderate, and the morphological and ultrastructural damages, observed with electron microscopy, were restricted to a small number of cells. E. coli exposed to food-grade TiO2 showed some internalization of TiO2 (7% of cells), observed with high-resolution nano-secondary ion mass spectrometry (Nano-SIMS) chemical imaging. Taken together, these data show that E171 may be trapped by commensal and transient food-borne bacteria within the gut. In return, it may induce some physiological alterations in the most sensitive species, with a putative impact on gut microbiota composition and functioning, especially after chronic exposure. © 2018 Radziwill-Bienkowska, Talbot, Kamphuis, Robert, Cartier, Fourquaux, Lentzen, Audinot, Jamme, Réfrégiers, Bardowski, Langella, Kowalczyk, Houdeau, Thomas and Mercier-Bonin.</field>

		<field name="AB">Introduction: One aim of the study was to evaluate the impact when added to feed of the two potentially probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) Lactobacillus plantarum K KKP 593/p and Lactobacillus rhamnosus KKP 825 on production performance, health, and the composition of gut microbiota. The complementary aim was to assess the safety of these strains in broiler rearing. Material and Methods: A total of 500 one-day-old Ross 308 chicks were divided into four groups. The experimental factor was the admixture of bacterial preparation to the feed at different doses: the recommended maximum dose, a dose ten times higher, the recommended minimum dose, and a zero dose for the control group not receiving bacteria. Results: Addition of bacteria to the diets did not have a significant effect on the final body weight, final body weight gain, nor total feed intake or feed conversion. However, lactic acid bacteria had a positive effect on chicken health. Mortality among chickens fed with LAB was reduced. Moreover, LAB feeding inhibited the growth of Salmonella spp. and Clostridium perfringens in the intestines. There were no significant differences in chicken performance by dose of bacteria in the feed. The group dosed with LAB ten times higher than the recommended maximum did not demonstrate changes in biochemical or haematological parameters of blood compared to the remaining groups. Conclusion: Feeding chicken broilers with two potentially probiotic LAB strains is safe and impacts animal health positively. © 2018 M. Kuprys-Caruk et al.</field>

		<field name="AB">Despite a reduction in colorectal cancer rates in recent years, colorectal cancer is still one of the leading cancers in the Western world. Increasing evidence suggests that a Western diet, high in calories and mostly relying on meat and a reduction in fiber intake, increases the risk for colorectal cancer. More than 800 epidemiologic studies led to the decision by the World Health Organization (WHO) to categorize processed meat as cancerogenic. However, studies like the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) point out strategies to reduce colorectal cancer risk. Especially a well-balanced diet, fiber-rich and reduced in meat, together with a normal body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference is negatively associated with colorectal cancer risk. A fiber-rich diet also affects the intestinal microbiota and is associated with an increase in the metabolite butyrate. Most recent studies showed that other aspects of the Western diet may also influence intestinal homeostasis. Certain dietary supplements and food additives seem to have negative effects in susceptible mice, resulting in severe colitis on the short-term and an increased colorectal cancer risk on the long-term. Besides nutrition, colorectal cancer chemoprevention is an important factor for patients at high risk such as Lynch syndrome patients. Most data is available on long-term, low-dose acetylsalicylic acid reducing colorectal cancer risk. Within this review we would like to elucidate the influence of drugs, diet and nutritional factors on colorectal cancer risk. © 2018, The Author(s).</field>

		<field name="AB">Dietary carbohydrate fibers are known to prevent immunological diseases common in Western countries such as allergy and asthma but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Until now beneficial effects of dietary fibers are mainly attributed to fermentation products of the fibers such as anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Here, we found and present a new mechanism by which dietary fibers can be anti-inflammatory: a commonly consumed fiber, pectin, blocks innate immune receptors. We show that pectin binds and inhibits, toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and specifically inhibits the proinflammatory TLR2-TLR1 pathway while the tolerogenic TLR2-TLR6 pathway remains unaltered. This effect is most pronounced with pectins having a low degree of methyl esterification (DM). Low-DM pectin interacts with TLR2 through electrostatic forces between non-esterified galacturonic acids on the pectin and positive charges on the TLR2 ectodomain, as confirmed by testing pectin binding on mutated TLR2. The anti-inflammatory effect of low-DM pectins was first studied in human dendritic cells and mouse macrophages in vitro and was subsequently tested in vivo in TLR2-dependent ileitis in a mouse model. In these mice, ileitis was prevented by pectin administration. Protective effects were shown to be TLR2-TLR1 dependent and independent of the SCFAs produced by the gut microbiota. These data suggest that low-DM pectins as a source of dietary fiber can reduce inflammation through direct interaction with TLR2-TLR1 receptors. © 2018 Sahasrabudhe, Beukema, Tian, Troost, Scholte, Bruininx, Bruggeman, van den Berg, Scheurink, Schols, Faas and de Vos.</field>

		<field name="AB">The gut microbiota acts as a real organ. It exerts important metabolic functions, and regulates the inflammatory response by stimulating the immune system. Gut microbial imbalance (dysbiosis) has been linked to important human diseases and inflammation-related disorders. The symbiotic interactions between resident microorganisms and the gastrointestinal tract significantly contribute to maintaining gut homeostasis. The present review summarizes our knowledge regarding the impact of different antibiotics causing such long-term consequences as decreased microbial diversity, modulation of the Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, Clostridium difficile overgrowth, and increased expansion of the opportunistic pathogens Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia spp., and Klebsiella spp. Also, food additives, such as emulsifiers and artificial sweeteners, which are meant to reduce the risk of obesity and diabetes, may actually increase the risk of diseases due to microbial alterations. On the other hand, dietary components such as polyphenols, omega-3 acids or curcumin may positively affect gut microbiota composition.</field>

		<field name="AB">The interactions between the gut microbiota and its host are of central importance to the health of the host. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are produced ubiquitously by Gram-negative bacteria including the gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. These vesicles can interact with the host in various ways but until now their complement of small molecules has not been investigated in this context. Using an untargeted high-coverage metabolomic approach we have measured the small molecule content of these vesicles in contrasting in vitro conditions to establish what role these metabolites could perform when packed into these vesicles. B. thetaiotaomicron packs OMVs with a highly conserved core set of small molecules which are strikingly enriched with mouse-digestible metabolites and with metabolites previously shown to be associated with colonization of the murine GIT. By use of an expanded genome-scale metabolic model of B. thetaiotaomicron and a potential host (the mouse) we have established many possible metabolic pathways between the two organisms that were previously unknown, and have found several putative novel metabolic functions for mouse that are supported by gene annotations, but that do not currently appear in existing mouse metabolic networks. The lipidome of these OMVs bears no relation to the mouse lipidome, so the purpose of this particular composition of lipids remains unclear. We conclude from this analysis that through intimate symbiotic evolution OMVs produced by B. thetaiotaomicron are likely to have been adopted as a conduit for small molecules bound for the mammalian host in vivo. © 2017 Bryant, Stentz, Le Gall, Sternberg, Carding and Wilhelm.</field>

		<field name="AB">The usage of aspartame, as one of the most widely used sweetener, has been approved in many types of food products. Moreover, many studies have proven that replacing sugar with aspartame would contribute favorable effects on several health parameters; such as, body weight, blood glucose level, and inflammatory status. In this experiment, we examined the effects of aspartame consumption on some biomarkers; which potentially acted as early signals for a personal metabolic status. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of aspartame on the expression of a number of molecular markers related with appetite regulation (fto), fat accumulation markers (fabp4 and alt2) and inflammation marker (tnf-α) in Sprague Dawley rats. The population of Clostridium coccoides was also observed to give an insight about the effect of sweetener consumption on gut microbiota profiles. 15 healthy, male, eight-weeks old Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a standard diet and divided into 3 groups (n=5 for each): water only, sucrose (30% b/v), and aspartame (0.15% b/v). Body weight was measured weekly and blood glucose measurement was carried out on day 1 and 40. At the end of the experiment, all rats were euthanized and blood was collected from the vein. The liver, brain, and visceral adipose tissue were excised, weighed, and grinded with liquid nitrogen. Feces samples were collected on day 0 and 40. At the end of our experimental period; the body weight, liver weight, and blood glucose level of sucrose-treated rats were significantly higher (p &lt;0.05) than aspartame and control group. Sucrose showed the lowest level of fto gene expression; yet, the fto gene expression in aspartame group was still lower than the control group. Expression of several genes considered as metabolic syndrome-related biomarkers were measured (fabp4, alt2, and tnf-α); and our data demonstrated that sucrose treatment gave the highest increase in expression level of those genes; while aspartame treatment showed much lower values. Furthermore, sucrose also caused a significant reduction in C. coccoides population; while, the C. coccoides population in aspartame group did not differ significantly compared to the control group. © 2017 The Authors.</field>

		<field name="AB">The healthy human body contains small amounts of metabolic formaldehyde (FA) that mainly results from methanol oxidation by pectin methylesterase, which is active in a vegetable diet and in the gastrointestinal microbiome. With age, the ability to maintain a low level of FA decreases, which increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. It has been shown that 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid or alpha lipoic acid (ALA), a naturally occurring dithiol and antioxidant cofactor of mitochondrial α-ketoacid dehydrogenases, increases glutathione (GSH) content and FA metabolism by mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) thus manifests a therapeutic potential beyond its antioxidant property. We suggested that ALA can contribute to a decrease in the FA content of mammals by acting on ALDH2 expression. To test this assumption, we administered ALA in mice in order to examine the effect on FA metabolism and collected blood samples for the measurement of FA. Our data revealed that ALA efficiently eliminated FA in mice. Without affecting the specific activity of FA-metabolizing enzymes (ADH1, ALDH2, and ADH5), ALA increased the GSH content in the brain and up-regulated the expression of the FA-metabolizing ALDH2 gene in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus, but did not impact its expression in the liver in vivo or in rat liver isolated from the rest of the body. After ALA administration in mice and in accordance with the increased content of brain ALDH2 mRNA, we detected increased ALDH2 activity in brain homogenates. We hypothesized that the beneficial effects of ALA on patients with Alzheimer's disease may be associated with accelerated ALDH2-mediated FA detoxification and clearance. © 2017 Shindyapina, Komarova, Sheshukova, Ershova, Tashlitsky, Kurkin, Yusupov, Mkrtchyan, Shagidulin and Dorokhov.</field>

		<field name="AB">Many essential functions of the human body are dependent on the symbiotic microbiota, which is present at especially high numbers and diversity in the gut. This intricate host-microbe relationship is a result of the long-term coevolution between the two. While the inheritance of mutational changes in the host evolution is almost exclusively vertical, the main mechanism of bacterial evolution is horizontal gene exchange. The gut conditions, with stable temperature, continuous food supply, constant physicochemical conditions, extremely high concentration of microbial cells and phages, and plenty of opportunities for conjugation on the surfaces of food particles and host tissues, represent one of the most favorable ecological niches for horizontal gene exchange. Thus, the gut microbial system genetically is very dynamic and capable of rapid response, at the genetic level, to selection, for example, by antibiotics. There are many other factors to which the microbiota may dynamically respond including lifestyle, therapy, diet, refined food, food additives, consumption of pre- and probiotics, and many others. The impact of the changing selective pressures on gut microbiota, however, is poorly understood. Presumably, the gut microbiome responds to these changes by genetic restructuring of gut populations, driven mainly via horizontal gene exchange. Thus, our main goal is to reveal the role played by horizontal gene exchange in the changing landscape of the gastrointestinal microbiome and potential effect of these changes on human health in general and autoimmune diseases in particular. © 2017 Lerner, Matthias and Aminov.</field>

The strains BGVLJ1-44 and BGRA43 showed good technological properties (fast milk curdling, strong proteolytic activity). In addition, the strain BGVLJ1-44 produces exopolysaccharide (EPS), BGHI14 is heterofermentative LAB strain with significant immunomodulatory effect, while the strain BGRA43 showed strong antimicrobial activity against different pathogens and exhibited significantly higher level of adhesion to Caco-2 cells comparing to other two strains. Both lactobacilli strains BGRA43 and BGHI14 (p &lt; 0.05), as well as probiotic combination (p &lt; 0.01) significantly reduced the adhesion of Escherichia coli ATCC25922 to Caco-2 cells, while the strains BGVLJ1-44 (p &lt; 0.01) and BGRA43 (p &lt; 0.05) significantly reduced adhesion of Salmonella 654/7E (veterinary isolate). The results of farm trial revealed that treatment of sows with new fermented dairy probiotic influenced the piglets' gut colonization with beneficial bacteria and reduced the number of enterobacteriaceae in litters from some treated sows (no significant due to high variability among animals). Finally, this is the first study reporting that the treatment of sows with probiotic combination resulted in the improved microbiota diversity in neonatal piglets. © 2017 Veljovic, Dinic, Lukic, Mihajlovic, Tolinacki, Živkovic, Begovic, Mrvaljevic, Golic and Terzic-Vidojevic.</field>

		<field name="AB">Inulin and other fructans that provide health benefits are accumulated in Agave salmiana. Currently, Agave species are only exploited for the production of alcoholic beverages. Few reports of beneficial effects of fructans obtained from A. salmiana have been presented and therefore the goal of this study was to examine the specific stimulation of probiotic bacteria by A. salmiana powder in comparison to commercial prebiotic products with different bacteria. The composition of A. salmiana that includes fructooligosaccharides (FOS) supports the growth of probiotic bacteria. Inulin Orafti GR showed almost the same stimulation to probiotic bacteria in comparison to A. salmiana. Lactobacillus acidophilus showed the best growth with A. salmiana, decreased the final pH-value to the lowest level and produced the highest concentration of lactate. The structural heterogeneity of fructans from A. salmiana is useful as prebiotic and to maintain persistence of probiotic strains in vivo. The variation of gut microbiota composition that might be caused by microbiota-targeted therapies might also be influenced. Future research should work towards optimizing the FOS content and profile in the plants by selection of plant varieties or changing agronomic and postharvest practice to develop their innovative applications for the food industry and the health promotion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd</field>

		<field name="AB">Functional oligosaccharides, known as prebiotics, and ordinary dietary fiber have important roles in modulating the structure of intestinal microbiota. To investigate their effects on the intestinal microecosystem, three kinds of diets containing different prebiotics were used to feed mice for 3 weeks, as follows: GI (galacto-oligosaccharides and inulin), PF (polydextrose and insoluble dietary fiber from bran), and a GI/PF mixture (GI and PF, 1:1), 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolic analysis of mice feces were then conducted. Compared to the control group, the different prebiotics diets had varying effects on the structure and diversity of intestinal microbiota. GI and PF supplementation led to significant changes in intestinal microbiota, including an increase of Bacteroides and a decrease of Alloprevotella in the GI-fed, but those changes were opposite in PF fed group. Intriguing, in the GI/PF mixture-fed group, intestinal microbiota had the similar structure as the control groups, and flora diversity was upregulated. Fecal metabolic profiling showed that the diversity of intestinal microbiota was helpful in maintaining the stability of fecal metabolites. Our results showed that a single type of oligosaccharides or dietary fiber caused the reduction of bacteria species, and selectively promoted the growth of Bacteroides or Alloprevotella bacteria, resulting in an increase in diamine oxidase (DAO) and/or trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) values which was detrimental to health. However, the flora diversity was improved and the DAO values was significantly decreased when the addition of nutritionally balanced GI/PF mixture. Thus, we suggested that maintaining microbiota diversity and the abundance of dominant bacteria in the intestine is extremely important for the health, and that the addition of a combination of oligosaccharides and dietary fiber helps maintain the health of the intestinal microecosystem. © 2017 Cheng, Lu, Li, Lin, Zhang, Wei, Sun, Chi, Bi, Yang, Jiang and Yuan.</field>

		<field name="AB">The composition of the gut microbiota of mammals is greatly influenced by diet. Therefore, evaluation of different food ingredients that may promote changes in the gut microbiota composition is an attractive approach to treat microbiota disturbances. In this study, three dietary fibers, such as inulin (I, 10%), resistant starch (RS, 10%), and citrus pectin (3%), were employed as supplements to normal chow diet of adult male rats for 2 weeks. Fecal microbiota composition and corresponding metabolite profiles were assessed before and after prebiotics supplementation. A general increase in the Bacteroidetes phylum was detected with a concurrent reduction in Firmicutes, in particular for I and RS experiments, while additional changes in the microbiota composition were evident at lower taxonomic levels for all the three substrates. Such modifications in the microbiota composition were correlated with changes in metabolic profiles of animals, in particular changes in acetate and succinate levels. This study represents a first attempt to modulate selectively the abundance and/or metabolic activity of various members of the gut microbiota by means of dietary fiber. © 2017 Ferrario, Statello, Carnevali, Mancabelli, Milani, Mangifesta, Duranti, Lugli, Jimenez, Lodge, Viappiani, Alessandri, Dall'Asta, Del Rio, Sgoifo, van Sinderen, Ventura and Turroni.</field>

		<field name="AB">Sucralose is the most widely used artificial sweetener, and its health effects have been highly debated over the years. In particular, previous studies have shown that sucralose consumption can alter the gut microbiota. The gut microbiome plays a key role in processes related to host health, such as food digestion and fermentation, immune cell development, and enteric nervous system regulation. Inflammation is one of the most common effects associated with gut microbiome dysbiosis, which has been linked to a series of human diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate the structural and functional effects of sucralose on the gut microbiota and associated inflammation in the host. In this study, C57BL/6 male mice received sucralose in their drinking water for 6 months. The difference in gut microbiota composition and metabolites between control and sucralose-treated mice was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, functional gene enrichment analysis and metabolomics. Inflammatory gene expression in tissues was analyzed by RT-PCR. Alterations in bacterial genera showed that sucralose affects the gut microbiota and its developmental dynamics. Enrichment of bacterial pro-inflammatory genes and disruption in fecal metabolites suggest that 6-month sucralose consumption at the human acceptable daily intake (ADI) may increase the risk of developing tissue inflammation by disrupting the gut microbiota, which is supported by elevated pro-inflammatory gene expression in the liver of sucralose-treated mice. Our results highlight the role of sucralose-gut microbiome interaction in regulating host health-related processes, particularly chronic inflammation. © 2017 Bian, Chi, Gao, Tu, Ru and Lu.</field>

		<field name="AB">Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient sources added to Food (ANS) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the re-evaluation of pectin (E 440i) and amidated pectin (E 440ii) as food additives. An acceptable daily intake (ADI) ‘not specified’ was allocated by the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) for E 440i and E 440ii. Pectin and amidated pectin would not be absorbed intact, but extensively fermented by intestinal microbiota in animals and humans; products formed from pectins in the gastrointestinal tract are similar to manufactured pectin-derived acidic oligosaccharides (pAOS). There is no indication of genotoxicity for pectin and amidated pectin, although the available data were limited. No adverse effects were reported in a chronic toxicity study in rats at levels up to 5,000 mg pectin/kg bw per day, the highest dose tested. No treatment-related effects were observed in a dietary one-generation reproductive toxicity study with pAOS in rats at up to 6,200 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day, the highest dose tested. The Panel did not consider E 440i and E 440ii as having allergenic potential. A dose of 36 g/day (equivalent to 515 mg/kg bw per day) for 6 weeks in humans was without adverse effects. Exposure to pectins from their use as food additives ranged up to 442 mg/kg bw per day for toddlers at the 95th percentile (brand-loyal scenario). The Panel concluded that there is no safety concern for the use of pectin (E 440i) and amidated pectin (E 440ii) as food additives for the general population and that there is no need for a numerical ADI. © 2017 European Food Safety Authority.

		<field name="AB">The Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of xanthan gum (E 415) as food additive. Following the conceptual framework for the risk assessment of certain food additives re-evaluated under Commission Regulation (EU) No 257/2010, the Panel considered that adequate exposure and toxicity data were available. Based on the reported use levels, a refined exposure of up to 64 mg/kg bw per day in children for the general population, 38 mg/kg bw per day for children consumers only of food supplements at the high level exposure and 115 mg/kg bw per day for infants consuming foods for special medical purposes and special formulae (FSMPs), were estimated. Xanthan gum (E 415) is unlikely to be absorbed intact and is expected to be fermented by intestinal microbiota. No adverse effects were reported at the highest doses tested in chronic and carcinogenicity studies and there is no concern with respect to the genotoxicity. Repeated oral intake by adults of xanthan gum up to 214 mg/kg bw per day for ten days was well tolerated, but some individuals experienced abdominal discomfort, an undesirable but not adverse effect. The Panel concluded that there is no need for a numerical ADI for xanthan gum (E 415), and that there is no safety concern for the general population at the refined exposure assessment of xanthan gum (E 415) as food additive. Considering the outcome of clinical studies and post-marketing surveillance, the Panel concluded that there is no safety concern from the use of xanthan gum (E 415) in FSMPs for infants and young children at concentrations reported by the food industry. The current re-evaluation of xanthan gum (E 415) as a food additive is not considered to be applicable for infants under the age of 12 weeks. © 2017 European Food Safety Authority.

		<field name="AB">Nanotechnology is currently gained increased attention in various fields of science and technology like imaging, sensing, targeted drug delivery, gene delivery systems and artificial implants which is increasing the commercial usage of products including drugs in the various parts of the world. Because of their extensive consumption, it is necessary to study the harmful effects of nanomaterials particularly their ecotoxic effect and cytoxicity of nontarget organism (NTOs). In the present study, an attempt has been made to study toxic effect of silver and gold nanoparticles coated with chitosan on the gut microbiota of adult zebra fish adopting culture dependent methods. Respective metallic nanoparticles were synthesized by chemical reduction and stabilization of precursor salt and the synthesized polymer coated nanoparticles were characterized by electron microscopy studies and fourier transform spectroscopic studies. Adults of zebra fishes were administrated with lethal dose 50 (LD50) of polymer coated respective nanoparticles and their stress on gut microbiota studied by analysis of gut tissue homogenate of tested fishes adopting culture dependent methods. Chitosan coated silver nanoparticles brought about maximum reduction of microbial count which reveals drastic reduction of microbial count as increasing time periods. Less toxic effect on microbial count has been inferred from chitosan coated gold nanoparticles. © RJPT All right reserved.</field>

		<field name="AB">Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are used widely in consumer and industrial products, however, their influence on gut microbiota and metabolism and their mutual interactions are not fully understood. In this study, the effects of ZnO NPs on ileal bacterial communities, plasma metabolites, and correlations between them were investigated. Hens were fed with different concentrations of ZnO NPs [based on Zn; 0 mg/kg (control), 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg] for 9 weeks. Subsequently, ileal digesta and blood plasma were collected for analysis of microflora and metabolites, respectively. The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene of ileal digesta microbiota was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The predominant bacterial community in the ileum belongs to the phylum Firmicutes. The richness of the bacterial community was negatively correlated with increasing amounts of ZnO NPs (r = -0.636, P &lt; 0.01); when ZnO NP levels were at 100 mg/kg, microbiota diversity was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05). The community structure determined by LEfSe analysis indicated that Bacilli, Fusobacteria, and Proteobacteria were changed, and Lactobacillus was reduced by ZnO NPs. Moreover, metabolism as analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) indicated that glucose, some amino acids, and other metabolites were changed by ZnO NPs. Choline, lactate, and methionine were positively correlated with bacterial richness. In summary, ZnO NPs could influence the levels of microflora in ileal digesta, particularly Lactobacillus. Furthermore, the richness of the microbiota was related to changes in choline, lactate, and methionine metabolism. © 2017 Feng, Min, Zhang, Liu, Hou, Chu, Li, Shen, Zhao and Zhang.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background: Traditional fermented foods are a typical niche for probiotic Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and are involved with many therapeutic attributes. Among LAB, Lactobacillus plantarum is one of the most versatile members. Several L. plantarum strains have been documented for their probiotic attributes. There are limited reports on the evaluation of probiotic potential along with the therapeutic properties such as antioxidative ability. With this background, the present study was carried out to screen ‘Sannas’ which is collected from the Coorg region of Karnataka state, India, in the presence of potential probiotic L. plantarum strains for their therapeutic potential. Methods: Sannas was screened for the potential probiotic strains and identified using physiological, biochemical and molecular methods. A series of probiotic attributes were assessed for the selection of potential probiotic strains. Further, the potential probiotic strains were assessed for the in vitro antibiofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 7903. In addition, the cholesterol lowering ability of the potential probiotic strain using four-percent commercial fresh hen egg yolk as the cholesterol source. On the other hand, the in vitro antioxidant activity was also determined by a series of assays. Furthermore, the toxicity assessment was also done by the mitotic index using onion root tips as the source of chromosomes. Results: L. plantarum MYS14 isolated from an unexploited traditional cereal-based fermented food had good functional probiotic attributes and the antibiotic susceptibility was an intrinsic feature, thus consumption of this strain does not possess any health risk to humans and animals. In addition, the strain exhibited strong radical scavenging activity which might be useful in controlling or slowing the progress of several oxidative stress related disorders. On the other hand, the strain also exhibited better cholesterol assimilation, antibiofilm ability and the mitotic index revealed the non-toxic effect of the CFS. Conclusion: The probiotic therapy is gaining significant research interest in relation to gut microbiota in an attempt to better understand the therapeutic potential of probiotic strains isolated from unexploited traditional cereal based foods. It is confirmed that this L. plantarum MYS14 strain possesses several characteristics suitable for the production of various antioxidant probiotic products. Collectively, the results suggest that L. plantarum MYS14 may be used as probiotic strain for therapeutic applications. © 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.</field>

		<field name="AB">Silver carp is one of the most important planktivorous fish in Chinese aquaculture and plays a significant role controlling cyanobacterial blooms. A balanced gut microbiota is crucial for growth and health of the host because of its important roles in immune defense, digestion of complex carbohydrates, and production of enterocytes. In our study, the dominant bacterial and cellulolytic bacterial (Clostridium I, Clostridium III, Clostridium XIVab, and Fibrobacter) communities in the contents and mucus of the silver carp gut (foregut, midgut, and hindgut) were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses. The results revealed that the dominant and cellulolytic bacterial communities were significantly different among gut regions as well as in contents and mucus. Bacterial diversity and richness in contents and mucus increased along the gut and were higher in contents than those in local mucus. A sequence analysis of gut samples exhibited the conservative phylotypes of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. The gut of silver carp harbored an abundance of cellulolytic bacteria, particularly Clostridium XIV ab. The foregut segment had the highest proportions of the four cellulolytic bacteria, followed by the midgut and hindgut. However, the proportions of cellulolytic species in the silver carp gut was much lower than those in the terrestrial vertebrate gastrointestinal tract. We conclude that gut bacteria could help silver carp obtain energy from cyanobacteria, which may be why silver carp can maintain high growth rates during cyanobacterial blooms. © 2016, Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.</field>

		<field name="AB">Classical swine fever (CSF) is a highly contagious swine infectious disease and causes significant economic losses for the pig industry worldwide. The objective of this study was to determine whether small molecule metabolites contribute to the pathogenesis of CSF. Birefly, serum metabolomics of CSFV Shimen strain-infected piglets were analyzed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-Q-TOF/MS) in combination with multivariate statistical analysis. In CSFV-infected piglets at days 3 and 7 post-infection changes were found in metabolites associated with several key metabolic pathways, including tryptophan catabolism and the kynurenine pathway, phenylalanine metabolism, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid and urea cycles, branched-chain amino acid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism. Several pathways involved in energy metabolism including fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation, branched-chain amino acid metabolism, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle were significantly inhibited. Changes were also observed in several metabolites exclusively associated with gut microbiota. The metabolomic profiles indicate that CSFV-host gut microbiome interactions play a role in the development of CSF. © 2017 Gong, Jia, Zhang, Mi, Zhang, Xie, Guo, Shi and Tu.</field>

		<field name="AB">Diarrhea is a leading cause of increased mortality in neonatal and young piglets. Aberration of the gut microbiota is one important factor in the etiology of piglet diarrhea. However, information regarding the structure and function of the gut microbiome in diarrheic neonatal piglets is limited. To investigate the composition and functional potential of the fecal microbiota in neonatal piglets, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on 20 fecal samples from diarrheic piglets and healthy controls, and metagenomics sequencing on a subset of six samples. We found striking compositional and functional differences in fecal microbiota between diarrheic and healthy piglets. Neonatal piglet diarrhea was associated with increases in the relative abundance of Prevotella, Sutterella, and Campylobacter, as well as Fusobacteriaceae. The increased relative abundance of Prevotella was correlated with the reduction in Escherichia coli and the majority of beneficial bacteria that belonging to the Firmicutes phylum (e.g., Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, and Blautia) in diarrheic piglets. The differentially functional gene abundances in diarrheic piglets were an increase in bacterial ribosome, and contributed primarily by the genera Prevotella, this indicates a growth advantage of the Prevotella in diarrheic conditions. Additional functional gene sets were associated with the reduction of polyamine transport, monosaccharide and sugar-specific PTS transport, amino acid transport, and two-component regulatory system. These profiles likely impact the ability to transport and uptake nutrients, as well as the ability to fight microbial infections in the piglet gut ecosystem. This work identifies a potential role for Prevotella in the community-wide microbial aberration and dysfunction that underpins the pathogenesis of piglet diarrhea. Identification of these microbial and functional signatures may provide biomarkers of neonatal piglet diarrhea. © 2017 Yang, Huang, Zhao, Sun, Yan, Wang, Li, Huang, Zhang, Liu and Gun.</field>

		<field name="AB">Curcumin, the major active component of turmeric (Curcuma longa), is widely used as a spice and food-coloring agent, and also exhibits multiple biological activities. However, as curcumin has poor systemic bioavailability its pharmacology remains to be elucidated. Owing to the high concentration of curcumin in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, we hypothesize that it may exert regulative effects on the gut microbiota. We investigated the regulative effects of oral curcumin administration on the gut microbiota of C57BL/6 mice and found that curcumin significantly affected the abundance of several representative families in gut microbial communities, including Prevotellaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and Rikenellaceae. Considering the pathogenic associations between gut microbiota and many diseases, the present findings may help us to interpret the therapeutic benefits of curcumin. © 2017 The Author(s).</field>

		<field name="AB">In this study we addressed the questions whether an Atlantic brown algae extract (BAE) affects diet induced obesity in mice and which would be the primary targets and underlying key mechanisms. Male C57 BL/6 mice were fed a hypercaloric diet, referred to as high fat diet (HFD), supplemented with a freeze-dried aqueous BAE from Saccorhiza polyschides (5 %) for 8 months. Compared to the control group, dietary BAE supplementation significantly attenuated increase in body weight and fat mass. We observed apparent metabolic improvement including normalization of blood glucose, reduced plasma leptin, reduced fecal bile salt hydrolase activity with lower microbial production of toxic bile acid metabolites in the gut and increased systemic bile acid circulation in BAE-fed mice counteracting adverse effects of long term HFD feeding. Survival of mice receiving dietary BAE supplementation appeared slightly enhanced; however, median and maximal life spans as well as hepatic mTOR activation were not significantly different between BAE and control mice. We suggest that the beneficial metabolic effects of our BAE are at least partly mediated by alterations in gut microbiota associated with fermentation of indigestible polysaccharides that are major components of brown algae such as alginates and fucoidans. We moreover propose a multi-factorial mechanism that involves profound alterations in bile acid homeostasis, changes in intestinal and systemic glucose metabolism likely including increased intestinal gluconeogenesis, increased activity of the intestinally derived hormone GLP-1 contributing to promote systemic insulin sensitivity, and inhibition of a-amylase activity, which expectably limits dietary carbohydrate digestion and glucose release. © Huebbe et al.</field>

		<field name="AB">The present study was carried out to determine whether low dose of zinc oxide nanoparticles (Nano-ZnO) could serve as a potential substitute of pharmacological dose of traditional ZnO in weaned piglets. 180 crossbred weaning piglets were randomly assigned to 3 treatments. Experimental animals were fed basal diet supplemented with 0 mg Zn/kg (Control), 600 mg Zn/kg (Nano-ZnO) and 2000 mg Zn/kg (ZnO) for 14 days. On day 14 after weaning, the piglets fed Nano-ZnO did not differ from those fed traditional ZnO in growth performance and jejunal morphology, while Nano-ZnO treatment could significantly alleviate the incidence of diarrhea (P &lt; 0.05). In jejunum, the mRNA expressions of intestinal antioxidant enzymes and tight junction proteins were increased (P &lt; 0.05) in Nano-ZnO treatment. In ileum, the expression levels of IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α and NF-κB were decreased (P &lt; 0.05). Gene sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA revealed that dietary Nano-ZnO increased the bacterial richness and diversity in ileum, while decreased both of them in cecum and colon. Specifically, the relative abundances of Streptococcus in ileum, Lactobacillus in colon were increased, while the relative abundances of Lactobacillus in ileum, Oscillospira and Prevotella in colon were decreased (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, our data reveal that low dose of Nano-ZnO (600 mg Zn/kg) can effectively reduce piglet diarrhea incidence, similar to high dose of traditional ZnO (2000 mg Zn/kg), which may be mediated by improving intestinal microbiota and inflammation response in piglets, and help to reduce zinc environmental pollution. © Xia et al.</field>

		<field name="AB">Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), encompassing two main conditions - Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are multifactorial chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases with increasing incidence worldwide, especially in countries adopting a westernized lifestyle. Recent findings point towards a major impact of diet on human health since it can affect both the gut microbiota and the host response. Epidemiological studies have identified that the consumption of processed food, red meat, saturated fat and low fibre/vegetables are high-risk factors for IBD, while the consumption of fatty fish, fermentable fibres and vegetables lowers risk for IBD. Experimental studies have supported these findings. Animals fed certain specific diets demonstrate alterations in host immune responses and microbiota composition including the blooming of pathobionts as a result of diet treatment. Recent seminal studies have also provided evidence on the role of food additives such as emulsifiers in IBD and metabolic diseases. In the future, controlled trials and mechanistic studies will identify diet-induced beneficial or triggering mechanisms which will lead to the development of new treatment strategies for these debilitating diseases. © Biochemical Society.</field>

		<field name="AB">Gums and hydrocolloids represent a unique category of food additives. The various types of carbohydrates represented in this category provide many desirable functional properties and important characteristics in foods. Some of those properties include smooth textures, consistent rheological features, finished product stability, and possibly caloric reduction and modulation of the gut microflora. These food additives, many of which are extracted from natural sources, have a history of safe use in the food supply, as noted by numerous food regulatory agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives Combined Compendium of Food Additive Specifications.</field>

		<field name="AB">Depending on their chemical structure, pectic polymers may be fermented by different bacteria in the human gut and, therefore, display a different metabolite profile. We aimed to investigate the chemical structure of pectins from peach palm fruits and to evaluate their in vitro fecal fermentation profiles. A fraction (PW-AP) containing a linear highly methyl esterified homogalacturonan (degree of esterification of 70%) with minor portions of xylogalacturonan and type I rhamnogalacturonan was submitted to fermentation by the human gut microbiota. It produced significantly less gas than fructooligosaccharides (FOS) at all evaluated time points, and in 24 h presented a cumulative gas production ~27% lower than FOS. Drops in pH could be observed during fermentation of both FOS and PW-AP. Moreover, the pectin was slower fermented than FOS, though with a similar production of total short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and a lower production of branched chain fatty acids. The amounts of specific SCFA differed from that of FOS, with higher production of acetate (16.2%) and propionate (6.2%) and lower production butyrate (112%). The ratio of total SCFA production to gas production was 4.0 mL/µmol and 5.5 mL/µmol for FOS and PW-AP, respectively, indicating that the latter leads to less gas formation per µmol of produced SCFA. Overall, the understanding of how pectic structures are fermented brings new insights into the fiber utilization by the human gut microbiota and its relation to biological outcomes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd</field>

		<field name="AB">More than 2000 species of edible and/or medicinal mushrooms have been identified to date, many of which are widely consumed, stimulating much research on their health-promoting properties. These properties are associated with bioactive compounds produced by the mushrooms, including polysaccharides. Although β-glucans (homopolysaccharides) are believed to be the major bioactive polysaccharides of mushrooms, other types of mushroom polysaccharides (heteropolysaccharides) also possess biological properties. Here we survey the chemistry of such health-promoting polysaccharides and their reported antiobesity and antidiabetic properties as well as selected anticarcinogenic, antimicrobial, and antiviral effects that demonstrate their multiple health-promoting potential. The associated antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulating activities in fat cells, rodents, and humans are also discussed. The mechanisms of action involve the gut microbiota, meaning the polysaccharides act as prebiotics in the digestive system. Also covered here are the nutritional, functional food, clinical, and epidemiological studies designed to assess the health-promoting properties of polysaccharides, individually and as blended mixtures, against obesity, diabetes, cancer, and infectious diseases, and suggestions for further research. The collated information and suggested research needs might guide further studies needed for a better understanding of the health-promoting properties of mushroom polysaccharides and enhance their use to help prevent and treat human chronic diseases. © 2016 by the author; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</field>

		<field name="AB">Tween 80 is a widely used non-ionic emulsifier that is added to cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and foods. Because of its widespread use we need to understand how it affects bacteria on our skin, in our gut, and in food products. The aim of this study is to investigate how Tween 80 affects the growth and antimicrobial susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Pseudomonas fluorescens, which are common causes of spoilage and foodborne illnesses. Addition of 0.1% Tween 80 to laboratory growth media increased the growth rate of planktonic S. aureus batch cultures, and it also increased the total biomass when S. aureus was grown as biofilms. In contrast, Tween 80 had no effect on batch cultures of L. monocytogenes, it slowed the growth rate of P. fluorescens, and it led to formation of less biofilm by both L. monocytogenes and P. fluorescens. Furthermore, Tween 80 lowered the antibacterial efficacy of two hydrophobic antimicrobials: rifampicin and the essential oil isoeugenol. Our findings underline the importance of documenting indirect effects of emulsifiers when studying the efficacy of hydrophobic antimicrobials that are dispersed in solution by emulsification, or when antimicrobials are applied in food matrixes that include emulsifiers. Furthermore, the species-specific effects on microbial growth suggests that Tween 80 in cosmetics and food products could affect the composition of skin and gut microbiota, and the effect of emulsifiers on the human microbiome should therefore be explored to uncover potential health effects. © 2016 Nielsen, Kjems, Mygind, Snabe and Meyer.</field>

		<field name="AB">The gut flora are widely involved in the cometabolism with the host and have evident effects on the metabolic phenotype of host. This study performed a metabolome analysis of the intestinal microbiota specific for liver cirrhosis. The study population included patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh score of A (AP, n = 5) and B (BP, n = 5), and control subjects (NM, n = 3). Metagenomic DNA from fecal microbiota was extracted followed by metagenomic sequencing through Illumina MiSeq high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA regions. The detection of metabolites from fecal samples was performed using high-performance liquid phase chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Intestinal microbiota community and metabolite analysis both showed separation of cirrhotic patients from control participants, moreover, the microbiota-metabolite correlations changed in cirrhotic patients. Fecal microbiota from cirrhotic patients, with the reduced diversity, contained a decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes and an increased abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria compared with the normal samples. Analysis of metabolome revealed a remarkable change in the metabolic potential of the microbiota in cirrhotic patients, with specific higher concentrations of amine, unsaturated fatty acid, and short-chain fatty acids, and lower concentrations of sugar alcohol and amino acid, suggesting the initial equilibrium of gut microbiota community and co-metabolism with the host were perturbed by cirrhosis. Our study illustrated the relationship between fecal microbiota composition and metabolome in cirrhotic patients, which may improve the clinical prognosis of cirrhosis. © 2016 Wei, Jiang, Zhao, Li, Lin, Li, Lu, Sun and Yuan.</field>

		<field name="AB">The phenological synchrony between the emergence of overwintering herbivorous insects and the budding of host plants is considered a crucial factor in the population dynamics of herbivores. However, the mechanisms driving the interactions between the host plant, herbivores, and their pathogens are often obscure. In the current study, an artificially induced phenological asynchrony was used to investigate how the asynchrony between silver birch Betula pendula and gypsy moth Lymantria dispar affects the immunity of the insect to bacteria, its susceptibility to the entomopathogenic bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis, and the diversity in its midgut microbiota. The lysozyme-like activity in both the midgut and hemolymph plasma and the nonspecific esterase activity and antimicrobial peptide gene expression in the midgut were studied in both noninfected and B. thuringiensis-infected larvae. Our results provide the first evidence that phenologically asynchronous larvae are less susceptible to B. thuringiensis infection than phenologically synchronous larvae, and our results show that these effects are related to the high basic levels and B. thuringiensis-induced levels of lysozyme-like activities. Moreover, a 16S rRNA analysis revealed that dramatic decreases in the diversity of the larval gut bacterial consortia occurred under the effect of asynchrony. Larvae infected with B. thuringiensis presented decreased microbiota diversity if the larvae were reared synchronously with the host plant but not if they were reared asynchronously. Our study demonstrates the significant effect of phenological asynchrony on innate immunity-mediated interactions between herbivores and entomopathogenic bacteria and highlights the role of nonpathogenic gut bacteria in these interactions. © 2016 The Authors.

		<field name="AB">Background: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are part of the gut microbiota and produce ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides or bacteriocins with interest as natural food preservatives and therapeutic agents. Bacteriocin-producing LAB are also attractive as probiotics. Griffon vultures (Gyps fulvus subspecies fulvus) are scavenger birds that feed almost exclusively on carrion without suffering apparent ill effects. Therefore, griffon vultures might be considered a reservoir of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with potential biotechnological applications. Results: Griffon vulture feces were screened for LAB with antimicrobial activity, genes encoding bacteriocins, potential virulence determinants, susceptibility to antibiotics, genotyping and characterization of bacteriocins. In this study, from 924 LAB evaluated 332 isolates (36 %) showed direct antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria only. The molecular identification of the most antagonistic 95 isolates showed that enterococci was the largest LAB group with antimicrobial activity (91 %) and E. faecium (40 %) the most identified antagonistic species. The evaluation of the presence of bacteriocin structural genes in 28 LAB isolates with the highest bacteriocinogenic activity in their supernatants determined that most enterococcal isolates (75 %) encoded multiple bacteriocins, being enterocin A (EntA) the largest identified (46 %) bacteriocin. Most enterococci (88 %) were resistant to multiple antibiotics. ERIC-PCR and MLST techniques permitted genotyping and recognition of the potential safety of the bacteriocinogenic enterococci. A multiple-step chromatographic procedure, determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified bacteriocins by Edman degradation and a MALDI TOF/TOF tandem MS procedure permitted characterization of bacteriocins present in supernatants of producer cells. Conclusions: Enterococci was the largest LAB group with bacteriocinogenic activity isolated from griffon vulture feces. Among the isolates, E. faecium M3K31 has been identified as producer of enterocin HF (EntHF), a bacteriocin with remarkable antimicrobial activity against most evaluated Listeria spp. and of elevated interest as a natural food preservative. E. faecium M3K31 would be also considered a safe probiotic strain for use in animal nutrition. © 2016 The Author(s).</field>

		<field name="AB">Some clarifications are provided to this Letter; these do not alter any of the central conclusions but, rather, are provided in the interests of transparency and reproducibility. Our Letter indicated that experiments were performed on 4-week-old mice (unless stated otherwise). In fact, for several experiments, mice ranged from 5 to 7 weeks as follows: Fig. 4a-h, Extended Data Fig. 9g-w, b' -t', z: 5 weeks old; Figs 1, 2, 3a-d, 4i-o, Extended Data Figs 1a-d, 2, 4, 5s-v, 6, 7h-k, 8l-s, 9a-f, x, y, 10: 6 weeks old; Fig. 3e-l, Extended Data Fig. 1e-l, 5q, r, 7a-g, l-h', 8a-k, t-o', 9a': 7 weeks old. The weight gain versus time curves are affected by mouse age and hence explain why the kinetics of weight gain differ among control mice when comparing between different experiments. For each experiment, we listed the average n value for all the conditions within each panel, which differed from the exact n for each experimental condition within each figure, as shown in Supplementary Table 1 of this Corrigendum. Furthermore, our Letter reported relative changes in body mass and absolute mass of fat pads, thus not permitting assessment of absolute weight changes nor fat pad mass relative to total body mass. Hence, we provide measures of absolute and relative body and fat pad mass in a side-by-side manner in the Supplementary Data to this Corrigendum. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

		<field name="AB">OBJECTIVES:High-fat diets alter gut microbiota and barrier function, inducing metabolic endotoxemia and low-grade inflammation. Whether these effects are due to the high dietary lipid content or to the concomitant decrease of carbohydrate intake is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether higher amounts of dietary fat reaching the colon (through orlistat administration) affect the colonic ecosystem in healthy volunteers and the effect of the prebiotic oligofructose (OF) in this model.METHODS:Forty-one healthy young subjects were distributed among four groups: Control (C), Prebiotic (P), Orlistat (O), and Orlistat/Prebiotic (OP). They consumed a fat-standardized diet (60 g/day) during Week-1 (baseline) and after 1 week of washout, Week-3. During Week-3, they also received their respective treatment (Orlistat: 2 × 120 mg/day, OF: 16 g/day, and maltodextrin as placebo). A 72-h stool collection was carried out at the end of Week-1 (T0) and Week-3 (T1). Fecal fat, calprotectin, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as well as the antioxidant activity of fecal waters (ferric-reducing antioxidant power), fecal microbiota composition (by deep sequencing), and gut permeability (Sucralose/Lactulose/Mannitol test) were determined at these times.RESULTS:Fecal fat excretion was higher in the O (P=0.0050) and OP (P=0.0069) groups. This event was accompanied, in the O group, by an increased calprotectin content (P=0.047) and a decreased fecal antioxidant activity (P=0.047). However, these alterations did not alter gut barrier function and the changes observed in the composition of the fecal microbiota only affected bacterial populations with low relative abundance (&lt;0.01%); in consequences, fecal SCFA remained mainly unchanged. Part of the colonic alterations induced by orlistat were prevented by OF administration.CONCLUSIONS:In the context of an equilibrated diet, the acute exposition of the colonic ecosystem to high amounts of dietary lipids is associated with an incremented excretion of fecal calprotectin and pro-oxidant activity of the colonic content, in the absence of significant changes in the microbiota. © 2016 the American College of Gastroenterology All rights reserved.</field>

		<field name="AB">Microbial community in gastrointestinal tract participates in the development of the obesity as well as quite a few metabolic diseases in human. However, there are few studies about the relationship between gut microbiota and porcine fatness. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to perform 16S rRNA gene analysis in 256 cecum luminal samples from Erhualian pigs and 244 stools from Bamaxiang pigs, and adopted a two-part model statistical method to evaluate the association of gut microbes with porcine fatness. As the results, we identified a total of 6 and 108 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and 9 and 10 bacterial taxa which showed significant associations with fatness traits in the stool and cecum samples, respectively. Cross-validation analysis indicated that gut microbiome showed the largest effect on abdominal adipose by explaining 2.73% phenotypic variance of abdominal fat weight. Significantly more fatness-associated OTUs were identified in the cecum samples than that in the stools, suggesting that cecum luminal samples were better used for identification of fatness-associated microbes than stools. The fatness-associated OTUs were mainly annotated to Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Prevotella, Treponema, and Bacteroides. These microbes have been reported to produce short-chain fatty acids by fermenting dietary indigested polysaccharide and pectin. The short-chain fatty acids can regulate host body energy homeostasis, protect host from inflammation and inhibit fat mass development. Our findings suggested that the gut microbiome may be an important factor modulating fatness in pigs. © 2016 He, Fang, Huang, Zhao, Ke, Yang, Li, Gao, Chen and Huang.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background: Gut microbiota is now known to control glucose metabolism. Previous studies have shown that probiotics and prebiotics may improve glucose metabolism, but their effects have not been studied in combination with drug therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate whether probiotics and prebiotics combined with drug therapy affect diabetic outcomes. Methods: Two different study designs were used to test gut microbiota modulating treatments with metformin (MET) or sitagliptin (SITA) in male C57Bl/6J mice. In Design 1, diabetes was induced with four-week feeding with a ketogenic, 72 kcal% fat diet with virtually no carbohydrates. Mice were then randomly divided into four groups (n = 10 in each group): (1) vehicle, (2) Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis 420 (B420) (109 CFU/day), (3) MET (2 mg/mL in drinking water), or (4) MET + B420 (same doses as in the MET and B420 groups). After another 4 weeks, glucose metabolism was assessed with a glucose tolerance test. Fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were also assessed. In Design 2, mice were fed the same 72 kcal% fat diet to induce diabetes, but they were simultaneously treated within their respective groups (n = 8 in each group): (1) non-diabetic healthy control, (2) vehicle, (3) SITA [3 mg/(kg∗day)] (4) SITA with prebiotic polydextrose (PDX) (0.25 g/day), (5) SITA with B420 (109 CFU/day), and (6) SITA + PDX + B420. Glucose metabolism was assessed at 4 weeks, and weight development was monitored for 6 weeks. Results: In Design 1, with low-dose metformin, mice treated with B420 had a significantly lower glycemic response (area under the curve) (factorial experiment, P = 0.002) and plasma glucose concentration (P = 0.02) compared to mice not treated with B420. In Design 2, SITA + PDX reduced glycaemia in the oral glucose tolerance test significantly more than SITA only (area under the curve reduced 28 %, P &lt; 0.0001). In addition, B420, PDX or B420+PDX, together with SITA, further decreased fasting glucose concentrations compared to SITA only (-19.5, -40 and -49 %, respectively, P &lt; 0.01 for each comparison). The effect of PDX may be due to its ability to increase portal vein GLP-1 concentrations together with SITA (P = 0.0001 compared to vehicle) whereas SITA alone had no statistically significant effect compared to vehicle (P = 0.14). Conclusions: This study proposes that combining probiotics and/or prebiotics with antidiabetic drugs improves glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in mice. Mechanisms could be related to incretin secretion. © 2015 Stenman et al.</field>

		<field name="AB">The objective was to characterise degradation of myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakis (dihydrogen phosphate) (InsP6) and formation of inositol phosphate (InsP) isomers in different segments of the broiler digestive tract. Influence of an Aspergillus niger (PhyA) and two Escherichia coli-derived (PhyE1 and PhyE2) phytases was also investigated. A total of 600 16-d-old broilers were allocated to forty floor pens (ten pens per treatment). Low-P (5·2A g/kg DM) maize-soyabean meal-based diets were fed without (basal diet; BD) or with a phytase added. On day 25, digesta from different digestive tract segments were pooled per segment on a pen-basis, freeze-dried and analysed for P, InsP isomers and the marker TiO2. InsP6 degradation until the lower ileum (74 %) in BD-fed birds showed a high potential of broilers and their gut microbiota to hydrolyse InsP6 in low-P diets. Different InsP patterns in different gut segments suggested the involvement of phosphatases of different origin. Supplemented phytases increased InsP6 hydrolysis in the crop (PA &lt;A 0·01) but not in the lower ileum. Measurements in the crop and proventriculus/gizzard confirmed published in vitro degradation pathways of 3- and 6-phytases for the first time. In the intestinal segments, specifically formed InsP4-5 isomers of supplemented phytases were still present, indicating further activity of these enzymes. Myo-inositol tetrakisphosphate (InsP4) accumulation differed between PhyE1 and PhyE2 compared with PhyA in the anterior segments of the gut (PA &lt;A 0·01). Thus, the hydrolytic cleavage of the first phosphate group is not the only limiting step in phytate degradation in broilers. Copyright © 2015 The Author(s).</field>

		<field name="AB">As a strategy to find efficient lignocellulose degrading enzymes/microorganisms for sugarcane biomass pretreatment purposes, 118 culturable bacterial strains were isolated from intestines of sugarcane-fed larvae of the moth Diatraea saccharalis. All strains were tested for cellulolytic activity using soluble carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) degrading assays or by growing bacteria on sugarcane biomass as sole carbon sources. Out of the 118 strains isolated thirty eight were found to possess cellulose degrading activity and phylogenetic studies of the 16S rDNA sequence revealed that all cellulolytic strains belonged to the phyla γ-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Within the three phyla, species belonging to five different genera were identified (Klebsiella, Stenotrophomonas, Microbacterium, Bacillus and Enterococcus). Bacterial growth on sugarcane biomass as well as extracellular endo-glucanase activity induced on soluble cellulose was found to be highest in species belonging to genera Bacillus and Klebsiella. Good cellulolytic activity correlated with high extracellular protein concentrations. In addition, scanning microscopy studies revealed attachment of cellulolytic strains to different sugarcane substrates. The results of this study indicate the possibility to find efficient cellulose degrading enzymes and microorganisms from intestines of insect larvae feeding on sugarcane and their possible application in industrial processing of sugarcane biomass such as second generation biofuel production. © 2015, Dantur et al.; licensee Springer.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background.A predominantly T-helper type 2 (Th2) immune response is critical in the prognosis of pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. But the mucosal and systemic immune responses can be influenced by the intestinal microbiota. Methods.We assessed the effect of microbiota compositional changes induced by a diet enriched in 5% acidic oligosaccharides derived from pectin (pAOS) on the immune response and outcome of chronic pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection in mice. Results.pAOS promoted Th1 polarization by increasing interferon γ release, upregulating t-bet gene expression, decreasing interleukin 4 secretion, and downregulating gata3 gene expression. pAOS also sustained the release of keratinocyte chemoattractant, recruited polynuclear leukocytes and macrophages, stimulated M1 macrophage activation and interleukin 10 release, and decreased tumor necrosis factor α release in the lung. These effects led to increased bacterial clearance after the first and second P. aeruginosa infections. pAOS modified the intestinal microbiota by stimulating the growth of species involved in immunity development, such as Bifidobacterium species, Sutturella wadsworthia, and Clostridium cluster XIVa organisms, and at the same time increased the production of butyrate and propionate. Conclusion.These results suggest that pAOS may have beneficial effects by limiting the number and severity of pulmonary exacerbations in patients chronically infected with P. aeruginosa, such as individuals with cystic fibrosis. © 2014 © The Author 2014.

		<field name="AB">Consuming dietary fibre confers a number of large bowel health benefits through various interacting mechanisms. Here we describe and mathematically model how these key mechanisms respond to changes in the concentration of fibre consumed. The key markers of bowel health and function, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) and branched chain fatty acid (BCFA) concentrations, faecal bulk, transit time and pH are interrelated and captured in a model with just four parameters. The model was parameterised using animal (rat) data from the literature for faecal bulking, BCFA production, SCFA production and increasing acidity by the gut microbiota. Surprisingly, the model replicated the data in the absence of explicit representation of both the microbiota and their interactions with mucins. Interestingly, the model identified that there was an optimal fibre concentration at which SCFA was maximised, and further increases in fibre actually caused SCFA to decline. Extrapolating beyond the range of fibre content in the dataset predicted interesting results in terms of very short transit times for digesta and high faecal bulk, suggesting the need for new experiments to verify the range of fibre concentrations for which the model is valid. The parameterised and validated model may have value as a tool for predicting the potential health benefits arising from consuming varying fibre concentrations. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background: In our published randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, 3-period crossover trial, healthy adult men ( n = 21) consumed bars containing no supplemental fiber (placebo; NFC), polydextrose (21 g/d), and soluble corn fiber (SCF; 21 g/d) for 21 d each. Fecal specimens were collected between days 16 and 21 for fermentative end-product analysis and 16S ribosomal RNA bacterial gene amplification for bacterial taxa identification. Fiber supplementation decreased fecal putrefaction compounds and shifted abundances of several bacterial taxa. Objective: The objective was to perform whole-genome shotgun 454 pyrosequencing on the same fecal specimens collected in that clinical trial to obtain comprehensive fecal bacterial genome sequencing coverage and explore the full range of bacterial genetic information in the fecal microbiome, thereby using a systematic approach to study the impact of dietary fiber supplementation on fecal metabolites, bacterial taxa, and bacterial metagenomes. Design: Fecal samples were subjected to whole-genome shotgun 454 pyrosequencing to identify both fecal bacterial populations present and their functional genetic capacity. Results: Whole-genome shotgun sequencing results revealed that fiber consumption shifted the Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio, increasing the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes 12 ± 2% and 13 ± 2% with polydextrose and SCF, respectively, compared with NFC. Bivariate correlations showed a positive correlation between the Bacteroidetes: Firmicutes ratio and total dietary fiber intake but not body mass index. Principal coordinates analysis of Bray-Curtis distances indicated that bacterial gene composition was more similar in participants consuming fibers (polydextrose and SCF combined) in comparison with NFC. Shifts in bacterial gene abundances after polydextrose and SCF supplementation included genes associated with carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolism, as well as metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. Conclusion: This study conveys novel information about the impact of dietary fiber supplementation on the phylogenetic structure and functional capacity of the fecal microbiome of healthy adults.This trial was registered at clinical trials.gov as NCT02091349. © 2015 American Society for Nutrition</field>

		<field name="AB">Dietary polyphenols, including red wine phenolic compounds, are extensively metabolized during their passage through the gastrointestinal tract; and their biological effects at the gut level (i.e., anti-inflammatory activity, microbiota modulation, interaction with cells, among others) seem to be due more to their microbial-derived metabolites rather than to the original forms found in food. In an effort to improve our understanding of the biological effects that phenolic compounds exert at the gut level, this paper summarizes the changes observed in the human fecal metabolome after an intervention study consisting of a daily consumption of 250 mL of wine during four weeks by healthy volunteers (n = 33). It assembles data from two analytical approaches: (1) UPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of phenolic metabolites in fecal solutions (targeted analysis); and (2) UHPLC-TOF MS analysis of the fecal solutions (non-targeted analysis). Both approaches revealed statistically-significant changes in the concentration of several metabolites as a consequence of the wine intake. Similarity and complementarity between targeted and non-targeted approaches in the analysis of the fecal metabolome are discussed. Both strategies allowed the definition of a complex metabolic profile derived from wine intake. Likewise, the identification of endogenous markers could lead to new hypotheses to unravel the relationship between moderate wine consumption and the metabolic functionality of gut microbiota. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</field>

		<field name="AB">Several studies have addressed the use of dietary fibers in the modulation of intestinal microbiota; however, information about other highly correlated components in foods, such as polyphenols, is scarce. The aim of this work was to explore the association between the intake of fibers and polyphenols from a regular diet and fecal microbiota composition in 38 healthy adults. Food intake was recorded using an annual food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Quantification of microbial populations in feces was performed by quantitative PCR. A negative association was found between the intake of pectins and flavanones from oranges and the levels of Blautia coccoides and Clostridium leptum. By contrast, white bread, providing hemicellulose and resistant starch, was directly associated with Lactobacillus. Because some effects on intestinal microbiota attributed to isolated fibers or polyphenols might be modified by other components present in the same food, future research should be focused on diet rather than individual compounds. © 2014 American Chemical Society.</field>

		<field name="AB">The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of four beverage formulations (prebiotic - fructooligosaccharide, probiotic - Lactobacillus casei Lc-01, synbiotic - fructooligosaccharide and L. casei Lc-01 and placebo) based on aqueous extracts of soy and quinoa, towards the human intestinal microbiota using the Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME®), a dynamic model of the human gut. To monitor the effects on microbial community composition, plate counts on specific growth media and a PCR-DGGE analysis were performed on samples from all colon compartments - ascending, transverse and descending. To verify the effects on microbial metabolism, we analyzed the ammonium and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) concentrations. The synbiotic beverage showed the best microbiological results in the ascending colon compartment, stimulating the growth of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp., and reducing Clostridium spp., Bacteroides spp., enterobacteria and Enterococcus spp. populations in this compartment. A larger reduction (p. &lt;. 0.05) of ammonia ions in the ascending colon was observed during the synbiotic beverage treatment. No statistical difference was observed in SCFA production among the treatments and the basal period. Plate count and DGGE analysis showed the survival of L. casei Lc-01 in the colon. DGGE analysis also showed higher richness and diversity of the Lactobacillus spp. community during the treatment with synbiotic beverage, with higher accentuation in the ascending colon. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.</field>

		<field name="AB">The gut microbiota is a bacterial bioreactor whose composition is an asset for human health. However, circulating gut microbiota derived endotoxins cause metabolic endotoxemia, promoting metabolic and liver diseases. This study investigates the potential of orally delivered microencapsulated Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697 to modulate the gut microbiota and reduce endotoxemia in F344 rats. The rats were gavaged daily with saline or microencapsulated B. infantis ATCC 15697. Following 38 days of supplementation, the treated rats showed a significant (P &lt; 0.05) increase in fecal Bifidobacteria (4.34 ± 0.46 versus 2.45 ± 0.25% of total) and B. infantis (0.28 ± 0.21 versus 0.52 ± 0.12 % of total) and a significant (P &lt; 0.05) decrease in fecal Enterobacteriaceae (0.80 ± 0.45 versus 2.83 ± 0.63% of total) compared to the saline control. In addition, supplementation with the probiotic formulation reduced fecal (10.52 ± 0.18 versus 11.29 ± 0.16 EU/mg; P = 0.01) and serum (0.33 ± 0.015 versus 0.30 ± 0.015 EU/mL; P = 0.25) endotoxins. Thus, microencapsulated B. infantis ATCC 15697 modulates the gut microbiota and reduces colonic and serum endotoxins. Future preclinical studies should investigate the potential of the novel probiotic formulation in metabolic and liver diseases. © 2014 Laetitia Rodes et al.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) exhibit overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and imbalance of colonic microflora. We previously developed a novel redox nanoparticle (RNPO), which effectively scavenged ROS in the inflamed mucosa of mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis after oral administration. The objective of this study was to examine whether the orally administered RNPO changed the colonic microflora in healthy mice and those with colitis. Methods: RNP O was synthesized by self-assembly of an amphiphilic block copolymer that contains stable nitroxide radicals in hydrophobic side chain via ether linkage. Colitis was induced in mice by supplementing DSS in drinking water for 7 days, and RNPO was orally administered daily during DSS treatment. The alterations of fecal microflora during treatment of DSS and RNPO were investigated using microbiological assays. Results: We investigated that RNPO did not result in significant changes to the fecal microflora in healthy mice. Although total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were not significantly different between experimental groups, a remarkable increase in commensal bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus sp.) was observed in mice with DSS-induced colitis. Interestingly, orally administered RNP O remarkably reduced the rate of increase of these commensal bacteria in mice with colitis. Conclusions: On the basis of the obtained results, it was confirmed that the oral administration of RNPO did not change any composition of bacteria in feces, which strongly suggests a protective effect of RNPO on healthy environments in intestinal microflora. RNP O may become an effective and safe medication for treatment of UC. © 2013 Springer.</field>

		<field name="AB">One-hundred-and-three isolates of Bacteroides ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, and B. xylanisolvens were recovered from cow, goat, human, and pig fecal enrichments with cellulose or xylan/pectin. Isolates were compared using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR), and phenotypic microarrays. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed high sequence identity in these Bacteroides; with distinct phylogenetic groupings by bacterial species but not host origin. Phenotypic microarray analysis demonstrated these Bacteroides shared the ability to utilize many of the same carbon substrates, without differences due to species or host origin, indicative of their broad carbohydrate fermentation abilities. Limited nitrogen substrates were utilized; in addition to ammonia, guanine, and xanthine, purine derivatives were utilized by most isolates followed by a few amino sugars. Only rep-PCR analysis demonstrated host-specific patterns, indicating that genomic changes due to coevolution with host did not occur by mutation in the 16S rRNA gene or by a gain or loss of carbohydrate utilization genes within these Bacteroides. This is the first report to indicate that host-associated genomic differences are outside of 16S rRNA gene and carbohydrate utilization genes and suggest conservation of specific bacterial species with the same functionality across mammalian hosts for this Bacteroidetes clade. © 2014 The Authors.

		<field name="AB">Microbes in human body play an essential role in immunity, health, and disease. The gut microbes have been found to be the most diverse and constitute the densest cell number in the human microbiota and studies continue to support the premise that commensal bacteria, largely anaerobic, serve to maintain microbial stability and colonization resistance by preventing overgrowth or domination with more pathogenic bacteria, through interactions within the microbial community and with the host. Early results have indicated that the imbalances in gut microbiota are related to numerous disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer (CRC), diabetes, and atopy. In patients with immune suppression due to high-dose chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or in patients undergoing radiation therapy, disruption of the microbiota through antibiotics as well as impairment of host immunity gives rise to perturbations favoring intestinal domination by pathogenic species, leading to increased bacterial translocation and susceptibility to systemic infection. Randomized and double blind placebo-controlled human studies using pro- pre- or synbiotics, with adequate follow-up are needed to formulate directions for prevention and therapy. Nano-formulation of phytonutrients for delivery to specific targets could revolutionize personalized medicine. © 2011-2016 Translational Cancer Research.</field>

		<field name="AB">Dietary fiber (DF) can be broken down into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetic, propionic and n-butyric acid by gut microbiota to obtain energy. Therefore, dietary fibers have effects on the balance of gut microbiota and the production of SCFAs. In the four-week feeding, mice were fed with four dietary fibers, including pectin, resistant starch (RS), fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) and cellulose. The results showed that the mice body-weight gain was the smallest (7.0 ± 2.3 g) when the mixture of RS-FOS-cellulose was ingested, followed by the mixture of RS-cellulose (7.2 ± 3.5 g) and FOS-cellulose (8.3 ± 2.5 g). Ingestion of the mixture of pectin-FOS-cellulose, RS-FOS and RS-FOS-cellulose can respectively increase the diversity of the gut microbiota with 12, 11 and 11 terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) detected (digested by Hha I). The maximum amount of total SCFAs were produced by the mixture of FOS-cellulose (5.504 ± 0.029 μmol mL-1), followed by pectin-FOS-cellulose (3.893 ± 0.024 μmol mL-1) and pectin-RS-FOS-cellulose (3.309 ± 0.047 μmol mL-1). In conclusion, the addition of DFs (pectin, RS, FOS and cellulose), in single or mixture pattern, can exert different effects. An amount of 10.7% of single DF in the diet cannot be conducive to the balance of gut microbiota after ingestion for a long time, however, it can help with body weight loss like the mixtures of DFs in this study; FOS is a very important component in the mixture of DFs for both the balance of the gut microbiota and the production of SCFAs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.</field>

		<field name="AB">Prebiotic intake is generally associated with alterations in the gastrointestinal microflora and blood serum lipids. However, less attention has been paid to the effect of prebiotics on the liver membrane lipids. We hypothesized that the reported alterations in the serum lipids might be related to changes in the liver membrane phospholipids in animals fed fructooligosaccharide (FOS)-enriched diet. To test this hypothesis, we studied the composition and structural organization of liver plasma membrane lipids isolated from rats fed FOS-enriched diet. The results demonstrated that sphingomyelin (SM) was augmented significantly in membranes from FOS-fed rats. Sphingomyelinase activity was lower in the membranes from the FOS-fed group which could underlie the observed increase in the content of SM. Also, the percentage of susceptible to oxidation cholesterol was lower in plasma membranes from FOS-fed rats. Concomitantly, the saturated/unsaturated fatty acids ratio and the structural order parameter (SDPH) were lowered in the membranes of prebiotic-fed rats. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the uptake of prebiotics such as fructooligosaccharides could influence the content of specific lipids and the fluidity of liver plasma membranes of experimental animals. These results suggest a possible lipid-related trail linked to the beneficial effect of prebiotics on the host organism.</field>

		<field name="AB">The proposition posed is that the value of amino acid conjugation to the organism is not, as in the traditional view, to use amino acids for the detoxication of aromatic acids. Rather, the converse is more likely, to use aromatic acids that originate from the diet and gut microbiota to assist in the regulation of body stores of amino acids, such as glycine, glutamate, and, in certain invertebrates, arginine, that are key neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (CNS). As such, the amino acid conjugations are not so much detoxication reactions, rather they are homeostatic and neuroregulatory processes. Experimental data have been culled in support of this hypothesis from a broad range of scientific and clinical literature. Such data include the low detoxication value of amino acid conjugations and the Janus nature of certain amino acids that are both neurotransmitters and apparent conjugating agents. Amino acid scavenging mechanisms in blood deplete brain amino acids. Amino acids glutamate and glycine when trafficked from brain are metabolized to conjugates of aromatic acids in hepatic mitochondria and then irreversibly excreted into urine. This process is used clinically to deplete excess nitrogen in cases of urea cycle enzymopathies through excretion of glycine or glutamine as their aromatic acid conjugates. Untoward effects of high-dose phenylacetic acid surround CNS toxicity. There appears to be a relationship between extent of glycine scavenging by benzoic acid and psychomotor function. Glycine and glutamine scavenging by conjugation with aromatic acids may have important psychosomatic consequences that link diet to health, wellbeing, and disease. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

		<field name="AB">A β-mannanase-producing bacterial strain Bacillus circulans M-21 was isolated from soil. The strain grew well when mannan (konjac gum, guar gum or locust bean gum) was used as sole carbon source. The optimum fermentation conditions were determined as follows: 4g/L guar gum as carbon source, 20g/L soybean powder and 5g/L (NH 4) 2HPO 4 as nitrogen source, initial pH8.0, and 32C. An extracellular β-mannanase was purified by anion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose Fast Flow. The purified protein exhibited a single band on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular mass of 33.4kDa. Kinetic analysis showed that the enzyme exhibited the strongest binding affinity to konjac gum. The β-mannanase activity reached the maximum at 50C and pH7.0, and was completely suppressed by Hg 2+ and Ag +. The β-mannanase degrading products were mainly composed by disaccharide, trisaccharide and tetrasaccharide, which were all neutral hexose polymers. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Microbial β-mannanases are applied broadly in industrial processes, such as improving the quality of food and feed, biobleaching of softwood pulps in the paper and pulp industries, and reducing the viscosity of coffee extracts. They are also found application in oil drilling and detergent industry. β-Mannanase is an ideal tool for the preparation of manno-oligosaccharides, which have been proved to be excellent prebiotics stimulating growth of human-beneficial intestinal microflora. Potential applications of manno-oligosaccharides are found in foods, beverages and confectionary, especially in functional food additives. In the current study a β-1,4-mannanase was extracted and purified from Bacillus circulans M-21. The research results showed that this enzyme is suitable for the preparation of glucomanno- and galactomanno-oligosaccharide. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</field>

		<field name="AB">Much attention has been focused recently on functional foods. Ume, the Japanese name for the apricot of Prunus mume Sieb. et Zucc., is an example of a Japanese traditional functional food. There are, however, few reports on the effects of fiber from this fruit on bowel function. With this objective, we prepared ume fiber to test the hypothesis that it can change gut function and intestinal flora in mice. Mice were fed an ume fiber (UF) or cellulose (CF) diet (control) for 40 days. The fecal weight, fecal lipids, plasma lipids and cecal composition of the microflora were analyzed. The amount of feces was significantly greater in the UF group than in the CF group (p &lt; 0.01). The fecal lipids content (% DW) of the feces sampled on the final day of the experiment were significantly greater in the UF group than in the CF group (p &lt; 0.01). Plasma non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations tended to be lower in the UF compared to the CF group (p = 0.058). Occupation ratios of Bacteroides and Clostridium cluster IV were significantly greater in the cecal flora of the UF group. Our results suggest that ume fiber possesses the fecal lipid excretion effects and feces bulking effects. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</field>

		<field name="AB">The sugar alcohol mannitol is the primary photosynthate of phaeophytes, and as such is an important dietary constituent for many marine herbivorous fishes. Sugar alcohols are not thought to be efficiently digested by vertebrates. Although vertebrates lack intestinal transporters for sugar alcohols, these compounds are thought to serve as substrates for fermentation by hindgut flora. Here, we measured mannitol in twelve species of New Zealand phaeophytes and in gut contents and gut fluid from five points along the gut of eight species of New Zealand marine herbivorous fishes: Odax pullus, Kyphosus sydneyanus, Kyphosus vaigiensis, Girella tricuspidata, Girella cyanea, Parma alboscapularis, Aplodactylus arctidens and Aplodactylus etheridgii. The mannitol content of the algae varied from 6.76% dry wt.±0.83 SE in Cystophora scalaris to 28.81% dry wt.±2.03 SE in Marginariella boryana. The fishes consumed varying amounts of mannitol, correlating with their consumption of phaeophytes. In O. pullus and K. sydneyanus the amount of mannitol in gut contents decreased markedly in the hindgut. The correlation of this decrease with the density of gut microbiota and fermentation products suggests that mannitol is fermented to short-chain fatty acids in the hindgut, rather than being directly taken up by the fish. Hindgut fermentation of mannitol may thus serve as an important mechanism for energy salvage in hindgut-fermenting fishes that feed on phaeophytes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.</field>

		<field name="AB">The effect of wild blueberry consumption on anthocyanin (ACNs) distribution and metabolism in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was investigated. Thirty-two rats were fed for 4 or 8 weeks with a control (C) or a wild blueberry-enriched diet (8%) (WB). Anthocyanin profile in plasma, urine, feces, brain, and liver was evaluated by LC-MS/MS, and significantly increased In urine and not in feces after 8 weeks on the WB diet compared to that in 4 weeks, but no anthocyanins were detected in plasma, liver, and brain samples either in the C or WB groups. Metabolites of ACNs were detected in the plasma, urine, feces, and tissues of both the C and WB groups, but the urinary excretion of hippuric acid increased significantly after 4 and 8 weeks of WB consumption. Thus, it seems that ACNs are metabolized by the intestinal microflora to respective phenyl-alkyl acids, which can be further metabolized to benzoic acid. In conclusion, ACNs are bioavailable in rats, and the extent of their metabolism and excretion Is based on diet duration. Additionally, urinary hippuric acid content could represent a potential biomarker of ACNs absorption and metabolism in the SD rat under the present experimental conditions ©2009 American Chemical Society.</field>

		<field name="AB">The intestinal microflora Bifidobacteria has been adapted to utilize, as a source of energy, complex carbohydrates that escape hydrolysis by human digestive enzymes, for example fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS). The ability of intestinal microflora to utilize carbohydrates in complex mixtures is of particular interest, even though few data have been reported. This paper presents the results obtained using an innovative analytical approach based on instrumental HPTLC-AMD (automated multiple development) to investigate the metabolic behavior of Bifidobacterium adolescentis MB 239 as a case study. Raffinose, FOS (sucrose, 1-kestose, nystose, fructosyl-nystose), lactose, and their monomeric moieties glucose, galactose, and fructose were simultaneously present as carbon sources in the solution to be fermented by the bacterium. The method proposed has enabled quantitative monitoring of sugar concentrations during the entire time-course of the processes. The complex sugar mixtures were separated by use of acetonitrile-acetone-water mobile phases on diol layers derivatized with 4-aminobenzoic acid. © Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.</field>

		<field name="AB">The objective of this study was to compare the in vitro fermentability of xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) with different degrees of polymerisation (DP) by the intestinal digesta collected in three distinct intestinal sections of the porcine intestinal tract: ileum, caecum, and distal colon. The studied oligosaccharides included commercial short-chain XOS (DP 2-5), and medium-chain (DP 2-14) and long-chain (DP 2-25) XOS obtained by autohydrolysis of brewery's spent grain (BSG), corn cobs (CC) and Eucalyptus globulus wood (EUC). The oligosaccharide and monosaccharide consumption, lactate and short-chain fatty acids concentrations were correlated with shifts on PCR titres of Bacteroides/Prevotella, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus/Pediococcus populations, by using group- and genus-specific primers. All tested XOS were extensively fermented by the piglet ileal, caecal and colonic microbiota. The rate of consumption of medium- and long-chain XOS was notably reduced in the fermentations by the ileal inoculum as compared to commercial XOS. EUC XOS, CC XOS and commercial XOS supported an enhancement of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli replication in a first stage of the fermentations. Apparently this stimulation was not selective, because Bacteroides/Prevotella replication increased in a second stage of the fermentations, coincident in time with the highest consumption rates of some XOS mixtures tested. Mostly due to the slow fermentability by the ileal microbiota, medium-chain and long-chain XOS mixtures can be regarded as promising functional candidates suitable to act as distally fermentable substrates. © 2007 Swiss Society of Food Science and Technology.</field>

		<field name="AB">The simultaneous development of metabolic diseases and changes in eating habits demonstrate that, in addition to the importance of each individual's genetic background, nutrition is a significant factor in the mechanisms leading to diabetes and obesity. In addition, recent studies have provided molecular and physiological data about the role of intestinalmicroflora as a nutritional component in the development of metabolic diseases. The human intestine hosts billions of bacteria, which are nourished and protected based on our eating habits and health. Furthermore, to ensure a symbiotic relationship with their human host, bacteria help us efficiently process food, thereby favouring the body's growth and the ability to adapt to the changing nutritional environment. Recently published results have shown that changes in intestinal microflora, under experimental conditions, impact the occurrence of obesity. Food restriction and, consequently, weight lost are associated with changes in intestinal microflora. We showed that a molecular component of Gram-negative bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), provides the nutritional signal responsible for the occurrence of metabolic diseases triggered by high-fat diets. LPS is the most potent inflammatory agent known, and we demonstrated that a continuous and very low-rate infusion of LPS is sufficient to increase weight gain, insulin resistance, and fasting hyperglycaemia. Knockout mice missing the main LPS receptor, CD14, were protected against the deleterious metabolic effects of high-fat diets. Consequently, our work will contribute to the development of new food additives able to reduce the impact of excessive energy intake on the occurrence of metabolic diseases and help define additional markers for the early diagnosis of metabolic diseases. © 2007 Springer Paris.</field>

		<field name="AB">The diet of earthworms includes soil organic matter, soil microbes and other microfauna, but the relative contribution of these dietary components to earthworm nutrition is not well known. Analysis of fatty acid (FA) profiles can reveal trophic relationships in soil food webs, leading to a better understanding of the energy and nutrient flows from microbiota to earthworms. The objective of this study was to determine the origin of FAs assimilated by the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris L. We analysed the pattern of FAs in: (i) the bulk soil, (ii) soil in the earthworm gut, (iii) the absorptive tissue of the earthworm gut wall, and (iv) the muscular layers of the earthworm body wall. Multivariate analyses performed on the FA profiles suggest that the microbial community in the earthworm gut differs from that in bulk soil. Diverse bacterial and fungal derived FAs, which earthworms cannot synthesize, were found in the earthworm gut wall and body wall, and in the neutral lipids (storage lipids) of the gut wall. The major compounds isolated were 20:4ω6, 20:5ω3 and 18:2ω6, followed by the monoenoic 18:1ω7 and 18:1ω9c, and the saturated 18:0. The microbial FA assemblage in the gut wall resembled the gut soil more than the bulk soil, and the body wall of L. terrestris showed the same microbial derived FA pattern as the gut wall, although at reduced concentrations. We propose the existence of a specific microbial community in the earthworm gut that provides FAs to the earthworm. It appears that L. terrestris may derive more of its energy and nutrients from gut specific microbiota than from microbiota already present in the ingested soil, based on the trophic relationships revealed through FA analysis. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

		<field name="AB">The inhibitory effects of laminaran and low molecular weight sodium alginate (MW = 49,000) against formation of ammonia, indole compounds and phenol compounds, putrefactive and harmful compounds, induced by human fecal microflora, were examined in vitro. Laminaran was fermented to acetate, propionate, n-butyrate and lactate. The alginate was fermented to acetate and propionate. Both of these polysaccharides inhibited formation of the putrefactive compounds. In the case of rats fed diet containing 2% (w/w) laminaran or low molecular alginate, the fermentation pattern agreed with that of the in vitro experiment. Laminaran suppressed indole, p-cresole and sulfide, significantly. These putrefactive compounds, in rats fed low molecular alginate, also tended to be lower. These results suggest that the fermentation of laminaran by intestinal bacteria suppresses the putative risk markers for colon cancer. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</field>

		<field name="AB">The effect of pre- and probiotics on the human intestinal microflora was investigated by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with specific 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes, and by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of specifically PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes. The prebiotic inulin was orally administered in the form of Raftiline® HP (Orafti, Belgium). Daily doses of 9 g were taken for 14 days by 10 healthy adult volunteers. The probiotic Bifidobacterium longum, encapsulated in gelatin/pectin capsules, was orally administered in the form of Bifina® (Morishita Jintan, Japan). Nine capsules were taken each day for 14 days by 14 healthy adult volunteers. For the prebiotic study, FISH probes were used to enumerate all bacteria, bifidobacteria, the Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium coccoides group (Erec group), Bacteroides, and eubacteria of the low G + C group. No significant changes were found in the total population of bacteria, the Bacteroides nor in the low G + C group during the study. The population of bifidobacteria increased significantly, while there was a significant decrease in numbers of the Erec group. The FISH analysis of the probiotic study focused on the enumeration of bifidobacteria only, which did not increase significantly during the study. Samples collected in both studies were analyzed by Bifidobacterium-specific PCR and DGGE. The results showed that a stable bifidobacterial population was present throughout each study. Using both FISH and DGGE, we have shown that for modulation of the bifidobacterial populations in the gut, prebiotics are better candidates than probiotics, since inulin increased bifidobacterial numbers without changing the species composition, whilst the probiotic had almost no effect.</field>

		<field name="AB">Acacia gums are commonly used food additives. It is currently unclear how extensively these non-digestible polysaccharides are fermented in the human large intestine. However, they have been shown to support bifidobacterial growth in vitro and may represent useful candidate prebiotics. In these investigations, in vitro 24-h batch incubations and chemostat continuous-cultures of human faecal bacteria were conducted using two acacia gums (Fibregum standard and Fibregum AS®). Our aim was to study the effects of these gums on bacterial ecology and fermentation in the large bowel. Fructooligosaccharides (Actilight®-950P) were also investigated as a reference. Both Acacia gums were extensively fermented by intestinal flora although there were marked differences in fermentation product formation and ecological effects, probably due to their differing botanical origins and/or biochemical characteristics. In particular, fermentation of Fibregum AS® led to significantly higher proportions of propionate both in batch and chemostat experiments. Both gums decreased Clostridium sp. levels but only Fibregum-standard induced higher Lactobacillus sp. counts compared to control. These bacterial modifications were highly dependant of the operating pH of the fermentation system with acidic conditions promoting both the prebiotic and the butyrogenic effects of fructooligosaccharides. In these studies, we have demonstrated that, similarly to fructooligosaccharides, Acacia gums can exert putatively beneficial effects on host health through both the improvement of the composition of the large intestine microflora and SCFA formation.</field>

		<field name="AB">1. A combined in vivo and in vitro study has been devised to investigate an observation, obtained by 1H NMR of urine, that Alp:Ap(f)SD (Wistar derived) rats kept under standard husbandry conditions did not excrete urinary hippuric acid (HA). meta-(hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid {m-HPPA} was identified as the major aromatic component in urine samples lacking HA. 2. Examination of urine from Alp:AP(f)SD and Zucker (obese negative) rats fed various diets showed that the lack of HA/presence of m-HPPA was due to diet and not to the strain of animal. This observation was reinforced by the demonstration that the administration of benzoic acid (BA) to rats not previously excreting urinary HA resulted in the return of this component to the urinary excretion profile. Thus rats receiving the standard diet were still capable of glycine conjugation. 3. Changing the diet of rats excreting m-HPPA led to the cessation of m-HPPA excretion and the return of HA urine excretion. Interestingly, switching back to the original diet did not cause the loss of HA and the re-emergence of m-HPPA. 4. In vitro studies on the two enzyme systems responsible for glycine conjugation (benzoyl CoA:synthetase and benzoyl CoA:glycine N-acyltransferase) in isolated liver mitochondria showed that m-HPPA did not inhibit either enzyme. However, m-HPPA was not found to be a substrate for the first reaction step explaining why it was found in the urine as the free acid and not as a glycine conjugate. 5. The absence and presence of m-HPPA and hippuric acid is suggested to be due to a combination of differences in dietary precursors of substrates for glycine conjugation and a dietary dependent redistribution of the intestinal microflora responsible for breakdown of plant phenolics and aromatic amino acids. Taken collectively this study emphasises how a simple diet change can cause a profound change in metabolism.</field>

Stevioside was incubated with salivary α-amylase, pancreatic α-amylase, saliva, pepsin, gastric secretion, pancreatin and intestinal brush border membrane enzymes of mice, rats, and hamsters as well as with intestinal microflora of mice, rats, hamsters and humans. None of these enzymes digested stevioside except the microflora of the rat and hamster cecal contents, which hydrolyzed it to steviol, and the microflora of mouse cecal content and human feces, which hydrolyzed it to both steviol and steviol-16,17 α-epoxide. Steviol-16,17 α-epoxide was then completely converted back into steviol. These results suggest that steviol might be the only metabolite produced by the intestinal microflora from various animal species and humans.</field>

		<field name="AB">Prompted by our limited understanding of the degradation of lignin and lignin-derived aromatic metabolites in termites, we studied the metabolism of monoaromatic model compounds by termites and their gut microflora. Feeding trials performed with [ring-U-14C]benzoic acid and [ring-U-14C]cinnamic and revealed the general ability of termites of the major feeding guilds (wood and soil feeders and fungus cultivators) to mineralize the aromatic nucleus. Up to 70% of the radioactive label was released as 14CO2; the remainder was more or less equally distributed among termite bodies, gut contents, and feces. Gut homogenates of the wood-feeding termites Nasutitermes lujae (Wasmann) and Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) mineralized ring-labeled benzoic or cinnamic acid only if oxygen was present. In the absence of oxygen, benzoate was not attacked, and cinnamate was only reduced to phenylpropionate. Similar results were obtained with other, nonlabeled lignin-related phenylpropanoids (ferulic, 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic, and 4- hydroxycinnamic acids), whose ring moieties underwent degradation only if oxygen was present. Under anoxic conditions, the substrates were merely modified (by side chain reduction and demethylation), and this modification occurred at the same time as a net accumulation of phenylpropanoids formed endogenously in the gut homogenate, a phenomenon not observed under oxic conditions. Enumeration by the most-probable-number technique revealed that each N. lujae gut contained about 105 bacteria that were capable of completely mineralizing aromatic substrates in the presence of oxygen (about 108 bacteria per ml). In the absence of oxygen, small numbers of ring- modifying microorganisms were found (&amp;lt;50 bacteria per gut), but none of these microorganisms were capable of ring cleavage. Similar results were obtained with gut homogenates of R. flavipes, except that a larger number of anaerobic ring-modifying microorganisms was present (&amp;gt;5 x 103 bacteria per gut). Neither inclusion of potential cosubstrates (H2 pyruvate, lactate) nor inclusion of hydrogenotrophic partner organisms resulted in anoxic ring cleavage in most-probable-number tubes prepared with gut homogenates of either termite. The oxygen dependence of aromatic ring cleavage by the termite gut microbiota is consistent with the presence, and uptake by microbes, of O2 in the peripheral region of otherwise anoxic gut lumina (as reported in the accompanying paper [A. Brune, D. Emerson, and J. A. Breznak, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61:2681-2687 1995]). Taken together, our results indicate that microbial degradation of plant aromatic compounds can occur in termite guts and may contribute to the carbon and energy requirement of the host.</field>

		<field name="AB">The major gut microflora colonizing the hind gut of a higher termite, Odontotermes obesus, included morphologically diverse bacteria, both coccoid and rod-shaped, along with spirochaetes, pseudomonads and actinomycetes. Flagellated protozoa were totally absent. When the gut extract was inoculated on plates containing carboxymethyl cellulose or cellobiose, higher numbers of bacteria grew than on plates without cellulosic sources. The gut homogenate exhibited strong hydrolytic activity when carboxymethyl cellulose, p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucoside or xylan were used as substrate, indicating the role of gut microbiota in the process of cellulose and hemicellulose digestion. Activities were highest in the hind gut, and the paunch was probably the major site of polysaccharide digestion in this higher termite. In vitro cultivation of some of the isolates revealed both cellulase and xylanase activities.

		<field name="AB">A new way of producing isomalto-oligosaccharide syrup from starch was developed. Isomalto-oligosaccharides contain one or more α-(1→6)-glucosidic linkages with or without α-(1→4)-glucosidic linkages. The isomalto- oligosaccharide syrups are receiving increased attention as food additives because it is thought that they help prevent dental caries and improve human intestinal microflora, acting as a growth factor for bifidobacteria. The new system for production of isomalto-oligosaccharide syrup is based on the strong α-(1→6)-transglycosylation reaction of neopullulanase. Bacillus subtilis saccharifying α-amylase was simultaneously used with neopullulanase to improve the yield of isomalto-oligosaccharides. The yield of isomalto- oligosaccharides was increased to more than 60%, compared with a yield of 45.0% obtained by the conventional system. To reduce the costs, the use of immobilized neopullulanase was investigated. Almost the same yield of isomalto-oligosaccharides was obtained by using immobilized neopullulanase.</field>

The pH was significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) on guar gum (6.1) and pectin (6.4) than on the other diets (7.2-7.6). The cecal concentration of VFAs was similar among groups, ranging from 62.5±12 for cellulose to 93.8±12 μg/g for pectin. Guar gum produced significantly more propionic acid than all the other groups, with a relative acetic-propionic-butyric-other acids ratio of 53-29-9-9, compared with 57-22-13-8 for pectin, 50-20-12-18 for cellulose, 51-21-15-13 for lignocellulose and 61-19-9-11 for fiber free. The in vitro fermentation showed a marked increase in guar (+210%) and pectin (+90%) fermentability when incubated with inocula from adapted rats, supporting the hypothesis of a change in the in vivo metabolic activity of the fecal microflora after long term feeding of these fibers. © 1989 Maxwell Pergamon Macmillan plc.</field>

		<field name="AB">Measurements of polysaccharide-degrading activity in different fractions of human faeces showed that bacterial polysaccharidases and glycosidases were primarily associated with the washed bacterial fractions. Amylase, pectinase and xylanase were the major polysaccharide-hydrolysing enzymes detected, whilst α-L-arabinofuranosidase, β-D-xylosidase, β-D-galactosidase and β-D-glucosidase were the most active glycosidases. Starch and 3 non-starch polysaccharides (NSP; pectin, xylan and arabinogalactan) were fermented by mixed populations of human faecal bacteria in batch culture. Detailed carbohydrate analysis demonstrated that starch and pectin were the most rapidly degraded substrates and that arabinogalactan and the relatively insoluble polysaccharide xylan were broken down more slowly. Free sugars and oligosaccharides did not accumulate in culture media with any polysaccharide tested. Time-course measurements of polysaccharide remaining in the batch culture fermentations showed that the arabinose side chains of pectin, xylan and arabinogalactan were co-utilised with the backbone sugars. In these cultures, polysaccharide-degrading activity was mainly cell-associated, but extracellular polysaccharidase activity increased as the fermentations progressed. Molar ratios of acetate, propionate and butyrate produced in these experiments were dependent upon the polysaccharide substrate tested. Molar ratios of acetate, propionate and butyrate in the starch, arabinogalactan, xylan and pectin fermentations were 50:22:29, 50:42:8, 82:15:3, and 84:14:2, respectively. The presence of starch did not inhibit the breakdown of arabinogalactan, xylan or pectin by faecal bacterial, providing evidence that multicomponent substrate utilisation occurs when complex populations of faecal bacteria are provided with mixed polysaccharide substrates. © 1987.</field>

The faecal elimination was a minor route, whereas the biliary excretion was about 42% of the dose and the glucuronide conjugates of I, II and X were common major metabolites. The biliary glucuronides were cleaved in the small intestine to the respective aglycones, which were reabsorbed, metabolised further, and excreted in the urine as the sulphate conjugate of X. Although small amounts of the mono‐, di‐and tri‐glucosides were found in the 0.5‐h blood and liver samples following oral administration of the tri‐glucoside of I, they were not detected in the urine, bile or faeces. Similarly the sulphate conjugate was one of the major urinary metabolites of germ‐free rats, dosed with the 14C‐glucosides via the oral or the intraperitoneal route, although they were excreted unchanged in certain amounts in the urine and faeces. The glucose conjugates were cleaved in vitro by gut microflora and in various rat tissues, including blood, liver, small intestine and small intestinal mucosa. The tissue enzymes showed a different substrate specificity in hydrolysis of the glucosides. However, they were not cleaved in gastric juice, bile, pancreatic juice or urine.

		<field name="AB">Four intense sweeteners have been, or are likely to be, used extensively in Europe. Saccharin and acesulfam-K are acidic cyclic sulphonamides which are absorbed well from the gut and eliminated in the urine without undergoing detectable metabolism. The increase in bladder tumours detected when male rats are fed high dietary levels of saccharin from birth cannot be explained simply by accumulation of the sweetener in the bladder. Cyclamate is metabolized by the gut microflora to cyclohexylamine, which is more toxic than the parent sweetener. The extent of metabolism shows very wide inter- and intra-individual variability. Aspartame is a dipeptide derivative which is hydrolyzed in the intestine. Thus the potential for toxicity is related to its metabolites, phenylalanine, aspartic acid and methanol. © 1985.</field>

		<field name="AB">The physiological response to the ingestion of glucose and glucose syrups is well documented in the literature. More recently, hydrogenated glucose syrups have become available but little is known of their physiological effect in man although sorbitol (hydrogenated glucose) has been used for many years in diabetic foods. Some metabolic effects of maltitol (hydrogenated maltose), which is a major component in hydrogenated syrups, have been described but the results obtained are equivocal. Our present work concerns physiological studies of hydrogenated glucose syrups and maltitol in animals and human subjects. In rats it has been shown that maltitol is utilized in some quantity by the gut microflora as shown by differences between conventional and germ‐free animals. Intravenously injected maltitol is excreted almost quantitatively in the urine producing no significant rise in blood glucose. This contrasts sharply with intravenously injected maltose which induces a significant blood glucose rise and of which less than 10% is excreted in the urine. In human subjects hydrogenated glucose syrup may be tolerated at levels between 80 and 120g per day without diarrhoea. Our studies indicate that although after an oral dose maltitol and hydrogenated glucose syrup induce lowered blood glucose and serum insulin peak values, compared with glucose, total influx of the three carbohydrates shows no difference. This may have importance regarding the use of maltitol and hydrogenated glucose syrup in diabetic foods. Long term feeding trials with human subjects, using maltitol and hydrogenated glucose syrup as the sole dietary carbohydrates, show that some adaption to the carbohydrates occurs during the trial as judged by elevated blood glucose and serum insulin peak values at the end of the trial compared with initial values.

		<field name="LID">10.1007/BF02582414</field>
		<field name="AU">Rackis J.J.</field>
		<field name="AB">Elimination of flatulence is a challenging practical problem associated with the comsumption of soybeans as well as other food legumes and other selected foodstuffs. The problem is compounded by the variability in susceptibility among individuals. Research has established that the oligosaccharides-verbascose, stachyose, and raffinose-are the major cause of soybean flatulence. They escape digestion and are fermented by intestinal microflora to form excessive amounts of carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Hot water treatment, aqueous alcohol extraction, and isoelectric protein precipitation processes have been adapted to produce flatus-free products commercially. At the household level, soaking combined with germination appears to be a practical means of producing soybean sprouts having low flatus activity. Food legumes, which include some oil-seeds, peas, and beans, as well as selected vegetables, contain enough of the oligosaccharides-verbascose, stachyose, raffinose-to be a major cause of flatulence in humans and animals. In the absence of alpha-galactosidases in the mammalian intestinal mucosa, these oligosaccharides escape digestion and are not absorbed. As a consequence, the active microflora in the ileum, colon, and fecal matter of the large intestine ferment them to form excessive levels of rectal gas, primarily carbon dioxide and hydrogen. In some instances, undigested starch and other carbohydrates contribute to the flatulent effect of diets. With 70% of the world's population being lactase-deficient (hypolactasia), susceptibility to flatulence would be more widespread with diets containing both food legumes and milk products. Use of food additives, antibiotics, and phenolic compounds to inhibit flatulence is not a practical approach. However, soya processing technology used to manufacture protein concentrates and isolates can be adapted to produce flatus-free products from other food legumes. Hot water treatment, aqueous alcohol extraction, or isoelectric protein precipitation insolubilizes most of the protein and removes the oligosaccharides. Tempeh and tofu are two other soya products that exhibit little or no flatus activity. Soaking, fermentation, enzymatic hydrolysis, and germination can also be used to eliminate oligosaccharides. Tests with humans and rats indicate that a combination of such processes can be used to reduce flatus activity. The beneficial effects of germination on flatulence, often conflicting and contradictory, have been attributed to failure to control conditions that ensure removal of most of the oligossaccharides. Whether the high-molecular-weight soybean polysaccharides (dietary fiber), which normally do not cause flatulence, can be modified during germination to become substrates for flatus production by the intestinal microflora is not known. Such an effect could compensate for the loss of stachyose and raffinose. © 1981 American Oil Chemists' Society.</field>
