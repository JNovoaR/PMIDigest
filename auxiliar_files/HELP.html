This interface is designed for an easier and more comprehensive exploration of a
set of publications from PubMed or other sources. 
It allows revising the articles sorting them by different
criteria, classifying in subgroups, highlighting important information or exploring their citation network, among
other things.
</p>

<!--
To know more about the four different sections of the interface go to "Sections".
To know more about the different functionalities avaiable to the user go to

<h1>Sections</h1>

<p>
The interface is divided in four main sections:
</p>


<h2>ARTICLE LIST</h2> <p><i>(top-left)</i></p>

<p>
The table lists all papers within the set, one per row. Click on any row to display the 
details for this paper in the "Details" section (see below). The fields (columns) are:
<p>

<ul>
<li> 	<b>"Ref. PMID"</b>: Reference (Authors. Journal. (Year). Volume (Issue): Pages) and 
 	 article identifier (e.g. PubMed ID for PubMed entries). 
 	 Click on the ID to go to the paper's full record in the corresponding resource.
 	 <!-- Some non-PubMed papers may not have an avaiable link.-->
<li>	<b>"Source"</b>: Database from which the article was obtained. PM stands for PubMed.
<li>	<b>"Type"</b>: Publication type:
	<ul>
 	<li>	<font color=#5dade2><b>R</b></font>: Review.
 	<li>	<font color=#c39bd3><b>C</b></font>: Clinical or randomized Trial.
 	<li>	<font color=#7dcea0><b>S</b></font>: Systematic review or meta-analysis.
 	</ul>
<li> 	<b>"Date"</b>: Publication date (year.month). Month="00" when only the publication year is known.
<li> 	<b>"Title"</b>: Paper title.
<li> 	<b>"#cit TOT"</b>: Number of citations in PubMed Central.
<li> 	<b>"cit/year"</b>: Ratio between the number of citations and the
 	 number of years since publication.
<li> <b>	"#cit INT"</b>: Number of "internal" citations (i.e. citations  
 	 from other papers within this set).
<li> 	<b>"Tag"</b>: Tag assigned by the user to the article. See "Tag papers" below. Empty by default.
<li> <b>"Sel."</b>: Selection. Allows the user to select one or more papers and operate with them. See below.
</ul>
<p>
The table <u>can be sorted</u> by any field clicking the
corresponding column header (press the header again to reverse the sort order).
This is useful, for example, to have at the top of the list the highly cited papers, the reviews, the newer articles, ... etc.
</p>

<h2>DETAILS</h2> <p><i>(top-right)</i></p>

<p>
This section displays the title and abstract of the selected paper. 
</p>
<p>
<u>Relevant 
MeSH terms are highlighted</u> coloring them according with the schema specified by the user (see above).
Additionally generic terms of interest (either belonging to the MeSH vocabulary or not) can be entered by the user and they will 
be highlighted in  
<font color="#a600ff"><b>purple</b></font>. (See "Enter new highlighted terms" below).
</p>
<p>
Although MeSH terms are only associated to PubMed articles, instances of them mentioned in articles from other sources are also
highlighted. Similarly, for a particular PubMed entry, all mentions in its title/abstract of any MeSH of the whole set 
are highlighted, irrespective of
whether they are indexed for that particular article or not.
</p>
<p>
This section also includes at the top the reference and the type of article, as well as the article ID, which is a link
to the article record in the corresponding database. At the bottom, links to clinical trial databases are included if available, which
lead to the corresponding record in these databases with all the details on the clinical trial associated to the publication.
</p>
<!--	
Note: the coloring of the terms is meant to include variations of the original mesh or
user terms (e.g. the word "bacterial" is colored in green, as it contains the mesh term
"bacteria").
-->


<h2>MeSH TERMS</h2> <p><i>(bottom-left)</i></p>

<p>
This table contain the whole list of MeSH terms associated to the PubMed articles in the set, as well as the
terms introduced by the user (See "Enter new highlighted terms" below).
</p>
<p>
Mesh terms are sorted by their frequencies in the set of articles where they are indexed. The user-introduced terms always appear 
at the top of the table irrespective of their frequencies. For each term, the following information is shown:
<ul>
<li>	<b>Mesh term ID</b>, linked to its Entrez page. For user-introduced terms, an internal, 
	 not linked, ID is generated.
<li>	<b>Term name</b>, colored according with the criteria described above.
<li>	<b>Links to other resources</b>, only for <u>microorganisms </u>, (link to the
corresponding NCBI Taxonomy page) and for 
	<u>chemical compounds terms</u> (links to different databases with chemical information). <b>Empty in other cases</b>.
<li>	<b>Frequency of the term</b>.
<li>	<b>List of papers that include this term</b>. Click on [+PMIDs] to display the complete list
	 and click on [-pmids] to collapse it back. Click in any paper ID from the list to show 
	 its details in the Details section (see above).
</ul>


<h2>CITATION NETWORK</h2> <p><i>(bottom-right)</i></p>

<p>
This section shows the network of internal citations between the papers. 
</p>
<p>
Each node represents 
a paper and each arrow a citation, going from the citing paper to the cited paper.
Nodes are colored by the number of internal citations received, from <b><font color=#436473>dark blue</font></b> (less) to <b><font color=#ecec00>yellow</font></b>
(more). Papers that don't participate in any internal citation (either citing or getting 
cited) are not included in the network. 
</p>
<p>Use the mouse wheel to zoom in or out the network. Drag the mouse in the background (outside any node)
to pan/move the representation.  It is possible to move the nodes to different places dragging them with the mouse. To select a bunch of nodes (e.g. to move them together) draw a box around them dragging the mouse with SHIFT pressed.
</p>
<p>
You can <b>left-click</b> on any node to show the 
details of the corresponding paper on the Details section (see above). Selected nodes, 
whose details are shown in the Details Box, 
are circled in <b><font color=#ff00fb>pink </font></b>. You can <b>right-click</b> on any node 
to highlight its connections: <b><font color=#00ffc5>blue</font></b> for incoming citations and <b><font color=#ff3030>red</font></b> for 
outgoing citations. Left-click in any part of the network to undo the highlighting.
</p>


<h1>Operations with articles</h1>


<h3>Tag articles</h3>
<p>
This functionality allows the user to assign tags to papers. These will be shown in the "Tag" field of the Article List.

To tag papers select one or more items from the Article List by checking the corresponding box(es) in the 
"Sel." column.  Then you can either tag these articles as important or use custom tags:
</p>
<ul>
<li>	Press <b>"Tag as Imp."</b> to tag  the selected articles as important (<u>Imp.</u>). Rows tagged this way
	 are highlighted with a green background.
<li>	Press <b>"Other tags"</b> to use custom tags. You can enter a name for a new tag in the text
	 box and press the "Tag selection" button to tag selected papers with it. Whenever 
	 a new tag is added in this way, it appears in the list of previously created tags 
	 and you can select it and press the bottom "Tag selection" button to reuse
	 it in forthcoming tag assignments. <b>Press "Clear" to delete the tag list.</b>	 
<li>	Press <b>"Untag"</b> to delete the tags for the selected papers.
</ul>
<p>
 <b>Note:</b> You can click in the "Tag" header from the papers table to sort the papers by tag.
</p>

<h3>Delete articles</h3>

<p>
This tool allows the user to (temporary) remove papers from the Article List. 
</p>
<p>
First, select the
paper(s) you want to delete by checking the corresponding box(es) in the "Sel." column, and then press
<b>"Del. selection"</b>. These papers will disappear from the table. To see the list of "deleted" papers, 
press <b>"Trash->"</b>. In this new table you can
select deleted papers and press <b>"Undelete selection"</b> to move them back to the
Article List. Press "<-Return" to leave this deleted papers table and return to the main Article List.
</p>

<h3>Enter new highlighted terms</h3>

<p>This function allows the user to enter new terms that will be highlighted in <font color="#a600ff"><b>purple</b></font>. 
</p>
<p>
For that, press
<b>"Enter new terms"</b> to display a new dialog box and there, write the new terms in the text box.
You can enter them one by one, pressing "Add" after writing each of the new terms, or 
you can enter many at once, separated by ";". You can also delete the list of user 
terms by pressing "Clear". After making all the changes (either adding or deleting), 
<u><b>you must press "Save changes"</b></u>.
</p>

<p>
Any word that contains one of the user terms will be colored in purple. User terms
must be at least three characters long. Terms written in lower case will match either 
upper case, lower case or mixed, but terms written in upper case will only match upper 
case. When entering acronyms, it's recommended to write them in upper case, to avoid 
unwanted matches (e.g. the term "RNA" should be enter in upper case to avoid matching 
words that contain "rna" such as "alte<u>rna</u>tive").
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> Make sure your new terms are colored in <font color="#a600ff"><b>purple</b></font> in the "Added" list. If not, you 
might have forgotten to press "Save changes". 
</p>

<h3>Save session</h3>
<p>
Use your web browser "Save page" functionality to save the current work session as a HTML file in the work folder. 
Select "web page, HTML only" option if
available. For example, in Firefox, go to "Menu > Save page as" and make sure the "Web Page, HTML only" option is selected.
</p>
<p>
To recover a saved session, just open the corresponding HTML file.
