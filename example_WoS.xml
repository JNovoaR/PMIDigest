		<field name="AB">Polyphenols possess a reduction in the risk of a number of metabolic disorders. Peach peel contains plenty of polyphenols; however, its effect on regulating lipid metabolism remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of peach peel extract (PPE) on lipid metabolism and gut microbiota composition of high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity mice. HPLC/DAD/ESI-MS indicated that there were a total of 19 polyphenolic compounds in PPE. PPE significantly inhibited lipid accumulation in HFD-fed mice. Meanwhile, PPE treatment regulated mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism. The results from 16S rRNA sequencing showed that PPE regulated the composition of intestinal microbiota, increasing the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae, Prevotellaceae, Alloprevotella, Akkermansia, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus, which were positively associated with symptomatic resistance to HFD. Our findings suggested that PPE may be used as an additive of functional food to improve the lipid metabolic abnormalities associated with obesity.</field>

		<field name="AB">Chitosan has been applied as a food additive due to its prebiotic functions, while the relationship between changes in the intestinal microbiota caused by chitosan and weight loss remains unclear. This study confirmed the weight control effect of chitosan in the context of high-fat diet consumption. Interestingly, chitosan increased the serum leptin level in the high-fat diet groups and increased the oral glucose tolerance in the low-fat diet groups. Chitosan reduced the chronic inflammation caused by high-fat diet consumption. Moreover, the intestinal microbiome was influenced by the chitosan intervention as the feeding time increased. Chitosan supplementation increased the anti-obesity-related species, such as Coprobacillus cateniformis and Clostridium leptum, and significantly decreased Clostridium lactatifermentans and Clostridium cocleatum. Spearman correlation analysis showed that Coprobacillus cateniformis and Clostridium leptum were positively correlated with serum leptin. This study suggests that the prebiotic effect of chitosan is closely related to the modification of the gut microbiota.</field>

		<field name="AB">Fish gut microbiota can be affected by factors such as diet, habitat, and genotype. However, whether the foregut and hindgut microbiota respond similarly to these factors is still ambiguous. Given the fact that foregut has more communication with fish habitat and food intake, we hypothesized that the foregut microbiota is possibly more affected by external factors (e.g., habitat), while the hindgut microbiota tends to be mainly influenced by the host itself (e.g., genotype). To test our hypothesis, the V4 region of the gut bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced by the MiSeq platform. A total of 1,139,703 high-quality sequences and 7,698 OTUs (without singlets) were obtained. Results indicated that the major factors that affect the fish gut microbiota patterns were the gut sections and habitats, rather than fish species. The foregut microbiota was indeed more similar to the water microbiota than hindgut microbiota, whereas the hindgut microbiota between fish species showed relatively more differences than that of foregut microbiota. Therefore, foregut and hindgut microbiota exhibited different response patterns to the habitat environments and host genotypes. This finding extended our understanding of the maintenance mechanism of fish gut microbial biodiversity.</field>

		<field name="AB">The pros and cons of monosodium glutamate (MSG), a common food additive, have been long disputed, whereas the effects of MSG consumption on human intestinal microbiome have not been fully understood. In the present study, metagenomics sequencing was performed to evaluate the effects of MSG on human intestinal microbiota (n = 12) during a four-week experiment. It was observed that MSG consumption did not significantly alter the intestinal microbial community structure and functional features of the subjects. Although some bacteria including Faecalibacterium, Megamonas, Blautia and Collinsella tended to change, there was no significant difference in the alteration of all genera. At the functional level, the microbial functions were rich, mainly distributed in membrane transport, amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism, but there was no significant difference between samples obtained at different times. Additionally, it was discovered that the impact of the individuals on intestinal microbiota was greater than that of MSG.</field>

		<field name="AB">The intestinal tract is inhabited by a large and diverse community of bacteria, collectively referred to as the gut microbiota. Composed of 500-1000 distinct species, the intestinal microbiota plays an important role in immunity and metabolism. However, alterations in its composition are associated with a variety of inflammatory diseases including obesity, diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Among many other factors, our diet impacts microbiota composition and function, in either beneficial or detrimental ways. In this addendum, we will discuss our recent findings on how dietary emulsifying agents can directly and detrimentally impact the microbiota, leading to inflammatory diseases and cancer.</field>

		<field name="AB">Glycerol monolaurate (GML) is a naturally occurring surfactant and is widely used as a food emulsifier. New evidence, however, has shown that intake of GML could result in metabolic syndrome as well as gut microbiota dysbiosis in mice. In this study, male C57BL/6J mice fed normal chow diet with or without GML supplementation were administered with Lactobacillus plantar strains isolated from Chinese sourdough for 6 weeks to investigate the influence of GML and the L. plantarum strains on body weight, serum lipid profiles, inflammatory responses and gut microbiota. The results showed that L. plantarum could attenuate the adverse effects induced by GML, especially the strain L. plantarum ZJUFT17, which showed good performance in suppressing body weight gain, lowering total cholesterol, reducing the serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha level and enhancing the alpha-diversity of gut microbiota in mice supplemented with GML.</field>

		<field name="AB">Auricularia polytricha possesses hypolipidemic effects and decreases lipid accumulation, leading to potential food additives for functional food processing. In this research, we explored the potential effects of A. polytricha noodles on hyperlipidemia and gut microbiota dysbiosis, and elucidated their possible regulatory mechanisms on lipid metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD) mice. A. polytricha noodles treatment significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced body weight gain, hyperlipidemia and liver fat accumulation. Meanwhile, A. polytricha noodles decreased the levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), total triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared with the HFD group. Furthermore, A. polytricha noodles could enrich the diversity of gut microbiota by decreasing the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes as well as the relative abundance of Deferribacteres and increased the relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia, which might contribute to the prevention of hyperlipidemia. This study indicated that A. polytricha noodles could modulate the gut microbiota and prevent hyperlipidemia and liver fat accumulation induced by HFD. (C) 2021 Beijing Academy of Food Sciences.

		<field name="AB">Purpose of Review Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder that causes inflammation in the colon and rectum and can be lethal to the patients. The dysbiotic intestinal microbiome is considered a major factor of UC, yet it needs more evidences. As there is no cure for UC, anti-inflammatory drugs, potent steroids, immunomodulatory drugs, or even surgery is used to manage the disease. The purpose of this review is to focus on the underlying factors involved in the disease pathogenicity, including host gut microbiome and novel therapies for treatment of UC. Recent Findings Due to disruption of intestinal epithelial layers, the intestinal microflora interacts with immune cells in the lamina propria, which in turn provokes an inflammatory response, which is subsequently exacerbated in the colon. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF), anti-integrin, Janus kinase inhibitors, siRNA, fecal microbiome transfer, synbiotics, and many other small molecules such as ozanimod are emerging as potential therapy for UC. Moreover, a nanoparticle-based drug delivery system enhances localized delivery of the drug to the inflammatory sites. Additionally, herbal-derived nanoparticles are also emerging as a novel drug delivery system in disease management. The homeostasis of gut microbiota is crucial for both prevention and remission of UC. Synbiotics and fecal microbiome transfer is emerging as potential treatment strategies for management of UC. The combination of multiple therapies may have durable therapeutic outcomes against the debilitating condition of UC. The outcome of the ongoing clinical trials of novel drugs will define the new therapeutic approaches in the treatment of UC for long-term remission.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background: Nanomedicine has become one of the most promising technologies to modernize the traditional food. However, not only the public perception of the new technology is uncertain, but also the regulators have not yet to agree on rules that apply globally. The gastrointestinal tract microbiota and its genes (the microbiome) are considered a fundamental part of the human body. The gut microbiota is a major part of the host microbiota and contains approximately 3 x 10(13) bacterial cells in a commensal relationship with the host. However, once the gastric ecosystem is altered, various bacterial species (e.g., antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus and Clostridium difficile) can increase and develop pathogenic phenotypes. Recent evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is involved in carcinogenesis and can enhance the activity, efficacy, and toxicity of anticancer therapies. Recently, there is fast-growing concern regarding the effect of nanoparticles on the human gut microbiota. Nanomaterials can enter the human body via skin contact, ingestion, and inhalation. Scope and approaches: In the present review, the recent advances on the roles of microbiota and nanomaterials in cancer therapy, the microbiota and their metabolic interventions via nanomaterials, microbial inspiration via nanomaterials, and the challenges associated with using nanomaterials in humans and animals is discussed. In short, this review will focus on the current status and future perspectives of gut microbiota targeted nanotechnology for cancer therapy and cancer-related metabolic diseases. Key findings and conclusions: The changes in the gut microbiota or microbiome play vital roles in human diseases such as cancer. Traditional microbiome treatments have led to improved cancer treatments in some cases; however, problems such as collateral injury to the symbiotic microbiome and reliability of these treatment methods have led to new technological developments designed specifically for cancer microbiota crossing point. Hence, the prosperousness of nanomaterials in cancer prevention has led to the idea that nanomaterials can alter the cancer-causing microbiome/microbiota and their metabolites as well as alter the cancer microenvironment. Therefore, nanomaterials can be used as novel strategies to treat cancer. However, this emerging research area requires further in vivo clinical trials to determine the exact mechanisms of action involved in treating cancer via nanomaterials. Further studies should explore the connection between nanomaterials, the microbiota, microbial metabolites, cancer and cancer-related microenvironments in animals and humans.</field>

		<field name="AB">Changes in the mammalian gut microbiome are linked to the impairment of immunological function and numerous other pathologies. Antimicrobial silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are incorporated into numerous consumer products (e.g., clothing, cosmetics, food packaging), which may directly impact the gut microbiome through ingestion. The human health impact of chronic AgNP ingestion is still uncertain, but evidence from exposure to other antimicrobials provides a strong rationale to assess AgNP effects on organ function, immunity, metabolism, and gut-associated microbiota. To investigate this, mice were gavaged daily for 5 weeks with saline, AgNPs, antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and metronidazole), or AgNPs combined with antibiotics. Animals were weighed daily, assessed for glucose tolerance, organ function, tissue and blood cytokine and leukocyte levels. At the end of the study, we used 16S rDNA amplicon and whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing to assess changes in the gut microbiome. In mice exposed to both AgNPs and antibiotics, silver was found in the stomach, and small and large intestines, but negligible amounts were present in other organs examined. Mice exposed to AgNPs alone showed minimal tissue silver levels. Antibiotics, but not AgNPs, altered glucose metabolism. Mice given AgNPs and antibiotics together demonstrated slower weight gain, reduced peripheral lymphocytes, and elevated splenic, but not circulatory markers of inflammation. 16S rDNA profiling of cecum and feces and metagenomic sequencing of fecal DNA demonstrated that combined AgNP-antibiotic treatment also significantly altered the structure and function of the gut microbiota, including depletion of the indicator species Akkermansia muciniphila. This study provides evidence for possible biological effects from repeated ingestion of AgNP-containing consumer products when antibiotics are also being used and raises concern that an impaired gut microbiome (e.g., through antibiotic use) can potentiate the harm from chemical exposures such as AgNPs.</field>

Fruit flies are used as a model system to study the impact that foods, food additives, and/or antibiotics have on the gut microbiome. One of the major bacteria in the guts of fruit flies is Lactobacillus, which is easy to grow in the lab. This exercise is done in three consecutive lab sessions. During Lab 1, students prepare a standard nutritive medium that has been mixed with a substance of their choice, add the fruit flies to the medium, and practice serial dilution with a simulation. During Lab 2, students plate mashed fruit flies on MRS medium to look at the change in Lactobacillus levels. During Lab 3, students count and determine the change in the number of Lactobacillus in their tested substance, Gram stain selected colonies, and discuss their results as a class. SALG surveys indicated a significant gain in their understanding of the microbiology concepts introduced in this lab.</field>

		<field name="AB">Antibiotics can have significant and long-lasting effects on the gastrointestinal tract microbiota, reducing colonization resistance against pathogens including Clostridium difficile. Here we show that antibiotic treatment induces substantial changes in the gut microbial community and in the metabolome of mice susceptible to C. difficile infection. Levels of secondary bile acids, glucose, free fatty acids and dipeptides decrease, whereas those of primary bile acids and sugar alcohols increase, reflecting the modified metabolic activity of the altered gut microbiome. In vitro and ex vivo analyses demonstrate that C. difficile can exploit specific metabolites that become more abundant in the mouse gut after antibiotics, including the primary bile acid taurocholate for germination, and carbon sources such as mannitol, fructose, sorbitol, raffinose and stachyose for growth. Our results indicate that antibiotic-mediated alteration of the gut microbiome converts the global metabolic profile to one that favours C. difficile germination and growth.</field>

H-2 produced by the intestinal microbiome from indigestible components is the major source of exogenous H-2. In this study, we screened a wide variety of indigestible components that induce H-2 production by the intestinal microbiome, which exhibits large diversity, and developed a beverage composed of cows' milk with galactooligosaccharide, maltitol, and glucomannan (H-2-producing milk). In clinical trials, the breath H-2 concentration of most volunteers was increased by consumption of H-2-producing milk 1 (each material: 1%) and H-2-producing milk 2 (galactooligosaccharide: 1.5%, maltitol: 1%, and glucomannan: 0.1%). The total range of H-2 production (area under the curve) increased and a higher peak concentration was observed compared with consumption of H-2 water or pure cows' milk.

		<field name="AB">Background: Many harmful substances have been found in foods, such as heavy metals, organic pollutants, pesticides and antibiotics, and food additives are widely used in the industry. Recent studies showed that these substances could affect the composition and diversity of gut microbiota, which plays important roles in health and diseases of host. Thus, these substances could show toxicities through disrupting the homeostasis of gut microbiota. On the other hand, some dietary bioactive compounds were found to restore the dysbiosis of gut microbiota. Therefore, certain dietary natural products could relieve the toxicities of harmful substances on human beings via regulating gut microbiota. Scope and approach: In this review, the influences of several harmful substances and additives on gut microbiota are summarized, and protective effects of dietary bioactive compounds are also discussed. It is hoped to provide a better understanding of dietary natural products to reduce toxicities of harmful substances on human beings by targeting gut microbiota. Considering wide existence of harmful substances and additives in foods, this topic would attract more attention in the future to protect human health. Key findings and conclusions: Gut microbiota plays a vital role in diseases and health based on human and most animal studies. Some gut microbes, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, could synthesize various essential nutrients for human growth. In addition, some Bifidobacterium strains, Clostridium tyrobutyricum, and Lactobacillus paracasei, were associated with anti-inflammatory property. Moreover, Anaerostipes, Corynebacterium, Dorea, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and Turicibacter, were also related to inflammation. Harmful substances, such as atrazine, polychlorinated biphenyl, and heavy metals, were mainly ingested through the contaminated water and foods, could disturb gut microbiota and be detrimental to health. Besides, gut microbiota dysbiosis was potentially caused by some food additives, which altered gut barrier and activated the immune response. On the other hand, some dietary natural products, such as melatonin, wheat bran, pectin, chlorogenic acid, and isoorientin, showed beneficial efficacy through restoring dysbiosis of gut microbiota caused by harmful substances. In the future, more attention should be paid to the exploration of more dietary plants and their components with gut microbiota regulatory effects in order to reduce the toxicities of harmful substances and protect human health.</field>

		<field name="AB">The low-grade inflammation observed in obesity is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and insulin resistance. Among factors triggering such inflammation, recent works revealed the role of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), so-called endotoxins. LPS are naturally present in the gut via the intestinal microbiota. Recent studies show that they can induce in plasma a metabolic endotoxemia after the consumption of unbalanced hyperlipidic meals. This article reviews recent knowledge gained on the role of intestinal lipid absorption and the composition of dietary lipids on: (i) the induction of metabolic endotoxemia, (ii) the types of plasma transporters of LPS and (iii) associated low-grade inflammation. Notably, lipids are present in foods under various physicochemical structures and notably in emulsified form. Our recent works reveal that such structure and the type of emulsifier can modulate postprandial lipemia; recent results on the possible consequences on metabolic endotoxemia will be discussed.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome is a highly diverse and intricate symbiotic ecosystem that offers a multitude of metabolic and adaptive benefits to the host. Diverse phytochemicals consumed as vegetarian diet or taken as food supplements are metabolized intensely in the GI tract and provide a range of nutritional and dietary therapeutic benefits. Insights into the gut microbial-biotransformation and plant-based therapeutics with reference to the diet and their interaction with the host offers development of futuristic dietary therapeutics that could boost the efficacy of nutraceuticals and plant-based formulations for human health. Scope and approach: This review provides insights into the gut microbial biotransformation of selective predominant dietary phytochemicals and the biological activities of the produced metabolites. It emphasizes the potential of GI microbes as probiotics or microbial food additives to improve utilization of plant-based diets, and enhance the bioavailability and bioactivities of phytochemicals. Key findings and conclusions: Vital and pro-health activities of plant metabolites produced as a result of gut microbial biotransformation emphasize the use of gut microbiota as novel probiotic candidates. The inferences summed up in the report could pave the way to develop potential probiotics to increase the efficiency of plant-based therapeutics towards enabling human hosts to cope with metabolic, inflammatory, proliferative, infectious and non-infectious diseases. We believe that the obtained and acquired new knowledge as discussed here has implications to develop dietary therapeutics that could steer the functioning of gut microbiota towards boosting host's nutritional and immunomodulatory efficiency.</field>

		<field name="AB">The molybdenum disulfide nanomaterial (nano-MoS2) is receiving increasing amounts of attention due to its special physicochemical characteristics. However, little is known about the influence of the different sizes of MoS2 on the intestinal metabolome and microbiome. In this study, C57BL/6 mice were exposed to nano-MoS2 and MoS2 micromaterials (micro-MoS2) via food premixed with 15 and 150 mg MoS2 per kg food for 90 days. The results showed that nano-MoS2 and micro-MoS2 exposure induced Mo accumulation in mouse organs, especially in the small intestine (SI) and large intestine (LI). Nano-MoS2 had a higher bioavailability and caused greater intestinal inflammation than micro-MoS2. Metabolome analyses showed that both types of MoS2 exposure changed the metabolic profiles of the intestine and intestinal microbiota. Ten and eight significantly altered microbial-host cometabolites were found in the SI and LI, respectively, and these were primarily involved in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. Additionally, both types of MoS2 exposure obviously changed the intestinal microbiota, especially in the LI. Correlation analysis suggests that micro-MoS2 could alter the intestinal metabolic profiles by changing the microbial community, but nano-MoS2 could cause similar effects by changing the microbial community and direct intestine toxicity. This study provides insights into the toxicity and health risks of nano-MoS2 and micro-MoS2 introduced by oral exposure.</field>

		<field name="AB">Gut microbiota plays a crucial role in nutrient digestibility and fish health. This study aimed to investigate the effects of alternative feed raw materials on the bacterial communities in the distal intestine and its relationship with nutrient digestibility in yellowtail kingfish (YTK), Seriola lalandi. Two 4-week digestibility trials were conducted to evaluate fish meal (FM), two sources of poultry by-product meal (PBM-1 &amp; PBM-2), blood meal (BLM), faba bean meal (FBM), corn gluten meal (CGM), soy protein concentrate (SPC) and wheat flour (WH). The nutrient digestibility value was determined using the stripping fecal collection method. Bacterial communities were characterized by high-throughput sequencing based on V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The most abundant phylum identified in the present study was Proteobacteria. A significant change in the distal intestine was observed in fish fed diets containing CGM and BLM, characterized by a reduction of species richness and diversity. Additionally, significant correlation between nutrient digestibility and intestinal microbiota was observed. Allivibrio, Vibrio, Curvibacter, Ruminococcaceae, and Clostridium were positively correlated, whereas Ralstonia genus was negatively correlated with nutrient digestibility. This study demonstrated that intestinal microbiota could be a useful tool for evaluating the digestibility of feed raw materials; however, further culture-based study is needed to confirm this observation.</field>

		<field name="AB">In recent years, xylan-oligosaccharides (XOS) have attracted much interest as an alternative sweetener for formulating an anti-obesity diet. The present study combining the plasma metabolic profile and gut microbiota analyses investigated the anti-obesity activity of XOS and the possible mechanism in mice. Our results showed that the dietary supplementations with 5% and 10% XOS could significantly slow down the body weight gaining and improve glucose intolerance. Lipidomic analyses revealed an alternation in 31 metabolic molecules, in particular the ceramide and diacylglycerol species, in the plasma, which were associated with the XOS supplement. Furthermore, gut microbiota analysis showed that XOS changed the composition of gut microbiota, leading to an increase in the relative population of genus Bifidobacterium, Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and Roseburia. In conclusion, the XOS supplementation could reduce the progression of obesity, improve glucose intolerance, and change the plasma lipid profile and gut microbiota composition.</field>

		<field name="AB">Although antibacterial silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are increasingly released into the environment and are very toxic to aquatic organisms, their effects on bacteria-based holobionts have been rarely studied. Here, we investigate the interactions between gut microbiota and zooplankton, Daphnia magna, under AgNP exposure through bioimaging, metatranscriptomic and gut microbiota translational techniques. The results demonstrated that the toxic symptoms of zooplankton were mediated by the gut microbiota at low concentrations of AgNPs, and the level of toxicity was influenced by the exposure time. At high AgNP concentrations, the mortality of zooplankton was due to the combined effects of the extinct gut microbiota and the accumulated toxicity. Exposure to AgNPs caused down-regulation of genes encoding proteasome, ATP synthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and beta-oxidation in the host, with a shorter body length and decreased digestion and reproduction ability. These perturbations were relieved possibly through microbial sulfidation of Ag+, via the aggregation of nanoparticles and possibly the recovered synthesis of short-chain fatty acids (SFAs). The reduced fluorescence of AgNPs and the symptomatic palliation observed in the AgNP-tolerant microbiota inoculated D. magna further confirmed the detoxifying role of gut microbiota. Overall, our findings provide fundamental knowledge about the effects of AgNPs on bacteria-based holobionts.</field>

		<field name="AB">Filtration products containing silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) have been used for water purification to provide drinking water for humans. However, it is unclear if differences in water chemistry influence their effectiveness or whether the presence of Ag in the filtrate (drinking water) impacts the gut microbiome. Using water samples differing markedly in chemical properties, we have found that &gt;= 99.89% of E. coli were killed in all cases, regardless of the water chemistry. However, in the first 25 mL of filtration, concentrations of Ag in most of the water samples (0.14-45.2 mg L-1) exceeded the limit for drinking water (0.1 mg L-1), differing depending upon water chemistry. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis revealed that up to 36% of the Ag in the filter paper was present as AgNO3 and 64% as Ag-NPs, with this AgNO3 likely contributing to the high Ag concentrations in the filtrate. Finally, we also examined the impacts of oral gavage of the Ag-containing filtrate on the mouse gut microbiome. It was found that Ag from the filtrate accumulated mainly in the liver and kidneys. In female mice, we also found that the Ag-containing filtrate increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in the faeces, whilst decreasing that of Firmicutes. Our data indicate that although Ag-NP-containing filter products have excellent antimicrobial properties, the high concentrations of Ag in the filtrate are potentially of concern for the gut microbiome and further work is required in this regard.</field>

		<field name="AB">Ingestion of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) can affect gut microbiota composition, and gut bacteria influences colonic epithelial function. The colonic mucus layer is a physical barrier that separates trillions of gut bacteria from the host intestinal epithelial cells. However, the interaction between titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs, gut microbiota, and intestinal barrier function is less clear. Here we show that short-term ingestion of TiO2 NPs (1 mg/kg/day for 7 days) led to increased Ti burden in male adult murine blood and intestine tissue, as well as colonic epithelial injury, suppressed expression levels of tight junction proteins, and reduced thickness of the luminal mucus layer. Accordingly, male adult mice fed TiO2 NPs had an altered gut microbiota composition, in which the richness of Bifidobacterium was significantly reduced, compared with controls. Mucus layer deterioration can be induced by transplanting microbiota from TiO2 NPs-exposed mice. Prebiotic inulin supplementation prevented TiO2 NPs-induced colonic barrier dysfunction. We hypothesize that the presence of distinct bacteria is crucial for maintaining the mucus layer and prebiotic supplementation can protect against engineered NPs-induced epithelial injury. Our finding may help to better understand the safety of NPs through ingestion.</field>

		<field name="AB">The aim of this study was to evaluate the prebiotic effect of pectin-derived oligosaccharides (POS) obtained from apple pomace on the growth and metabolism of microbiota from the human gastrointestinal tract as a function of the age of the host. The counts of major bacterial groups Bifidobacterium sp., lactobacilli, Clostridium sp., Bacteroides sp., Enterococcus sp. and Enterobacteria were assessed during long-term in vitro fermentation of mixed cultures in a prebiotic medium. Comparative assessment of bacterial diversity in the human fecal microbiota was performed relative to the age of the host, from childhood to old age, through younger years and middle age. The age group of the host was found to be an important factor that determined the prebiotic effect of POS, which was related to both the qualitative and quantitative composition of fecal microbiota and its metabolism. In contrast to the microbiota of elderly subjects, the child-derived intestinal microbiota underwent significantly different alterations in terms of the proportion and composition of lactic acid bacteria, leading to a more favorable pattern of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactic acid levels.</field>

		<field name="AB">Gut microbiota is closely related to the tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC), especially Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) could promote colorectal tumor growth and cause chemoresistance. Here, we developed a tumor-triggered release drug delivery gel to inhibit CRC cell growth in situ by intestinal perfusion. Antibiotic metronidazole (MTZ) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), the first-line chemotherapy drug of CRC, are individually incorporated into metal polyphenol network-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN), and then blended with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) to obtain an anti-CRC gel, AB-Gel. In vivo studies showed that AB-Gel could efficiently inhibit the growth and metastasis of CRC in an orthotopic mouse model attributing to the MTZ-induced modulation in the CRC-related microbiota. Chemotherapy efficacy against orthotopic CRC was significantly enhanced by the elimination of Fn. This strategy based on the combination of gut microbiota modulation and chemotherapy would be considered as an enhanced strategy for CRC treatment with potential use in the clinic.

The present studies report for the first time the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of pineapple byproducts fractions throughout simulated gastrointestinal tract, evaluates prebiotic potential and in vitro human microbiota fermentation. The pineapple flours promoted the human faeces fermentation through growth of beneficial strains, being corroborated by the decrease of simple sugars and the production of healthy organic acids (acetic, propionic and butyric acids) - well known short chain fatty acids. On the other hand, a high phenolic compounds content was release through flours digestion, developing an antioxidant environment within human gut. Thus, was possible to conclude that pineapple flour promoted a positive modulation in the overall system, proving a synergetic interaction of dietary fibre and polyphenols upon human microbiota.</field>

		<field name="AB">Objective: Xylitol has been commonly used as a sweetener and dental caries protective agent. However, how xylitol influences the composition and metabolism of gut microbiota is not known yet. This study aimed to dissect the changes of microbiota and their metabolites under xylitol supplementation in an in vitro colonic simulation. Materials and methods: A single-phase continuous fermentation model was used to culture human fecal flora and the 16s rDNA and short chain fatty acid were analyzed. Results and discussion: It was found that gut microbiota composition differentiated after xylitol supplementation only for the beginning 3 days. Xylitol significantly enhanced the relative amount of butyrate synthesizing bacteria such as Clostridium and Phascolarctobacterium. Meanwhile, xylitol increased the production of propionic acid and butyrate. An increase of Escherichia population sizes after xylitol supplementation was beyond expectation. By Spearman analysis, a positive relationship between Escherichia and Bifidobacterium was found. Conclusion: xylitol can rapidly enhance the total amount of short chain fatty acids, but its influence will disappear after 3 days of fermentation. Results of this investigation can be a guideline for the further investigations on xylitol in relation to gut microbiota and the daily intake determinations.</field>

		<field name="AB">Lignans are generally known for their beneficial impact on human health. In this study, we found that the water extract of silver fir (Abies alba) wood contains lignans, which constitute approximately 10% of the extract and include isolariciresinol, hydroxymatairesinol, secoisolariciresinol, lariciresinol, pinoresinol, and matairesinol. The antioxidant activity of the extract was measured by several in vitro assays and an assay in a eukaryotic cell model (yeast). The extract had greater in vitro antioxidative activity than ascorbic acid, resveratrol, or butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and similar antioxidative activity to epigallocatechin gallate. The intracellular antioxidant effect in the yeast gave indirect evidence that the components of the silver fir wood extract (SFWE) effectively pass through eukaryotic cell membranes and have higher in vivo antioxidative activity than ascorbic acid, resveratrol, tocopheryl succinate, or BHT and similar to epigallocatechin gallate. The in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of the lignans in the extract is not significant; therefore, it is reasonable to expect antioxidative effects from orally applied SFWE.</field>

		<field name="AB">This study investigated the effects of dietary fibres on gut bacterial abundance and metabolic activity in rats fed short-term. Faecal samples from rats fed for 7 days showed differences in the effects of dietary fibres on gut bacterial populations. Broccoli fibre, inulin, potato fibre and potato resistant starch significantly increased the faecal Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group compared with cellulose. Growth of pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. was decreased significantly in rats fed barley beta-glucan, citrus pectin, inulin and broccoli fibre diets. An increase in Bifidobacterium spp. and butyric acid levels, the so-called bifidogenic and butyrogenic effects, was observed in rats fed inulin and potato fibre diets. Organic acid concentrations and polysaccharide contents in the rat faeces confirm the fermentability of dietary fibres in the gut. This study demonstrates the positive effects of plant-sourced dietary fibres on gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity.</field>

		<field name="AB">Non-caloric artificial sweeteners (NAS) are among the most widely used food additives worldwide, regularly consumed by lean and obese individuals alike. NAS consumption is considered safe and beneficial owing to their low caloric content, yet supporting scientific data remain sparse and controversial. Here we demonstrate that consumption of commonly used NAS formulations drives the development of glucose intolerance through induction of compositional and functional alterations to the intestinal microbiota. These NAS-mediated deleterious metabolic effects are abrogated by antibiotic treatment, and are fully transferrable to germ-free mice upon faecal transplantation of microbiota configurations from NAS-consuming mice, or of microbiota anaerobically incubated in the presence of NAS. We identify NAS-altered microbial metabolic pathways that are linked to host susceptibility to metabolic disease, and demonstrate similar NAS-induced dysbiosis and glucose intolerance in healthy human subjects. Collectively, our results link NAS consumption, dysbiosis and metabolic abnormalities, thereby calling for a reassessment of massive NAS usage.</field>

Apples have been shown to have beneficial effects on vascular function, blood pressure, lipids, inflammation and hyperglycaemia. The cardioprotective effects of apples, and other fruits, have been primarily ascribed to their high polyphenol content. There is emerging evidence that the bioavailability and bioefficacy of polyphenols is affected by the food matrix in which they are consumed. Scope and approach: This review will discuss the differences in the consumption of apple as a whole food in comparison to the consumption of isolated key components, predominantly polyphenols and fibre. The bioavailability and absorption of major apple polyphenols, such as procyanidins, catechin, epicatechin, phloridzin, chlorogenic acid, and the quercetin glycosides, will be described. The methods by which apples may ameliorate risk factors for CVD will be discussed and results from key human intervention studies conferred. The list of studies described in this paper is exemplary and not exhaustive. Key findings and conclusions: There are a number of factors influencing the bioavailability of polyphenols in an individual including colonic microbial composition, the dose consumed and the presence of other polyphenols and macronutrients within the food matrix. There is evidence of a synergistic relationship between the fibre and flavonoids found in a whole apple, which is likely mediated in part by the gut microbiota. Further human intervention studies investigating the effects of apples of cardiovascular risk factors, and the critical role of the gut microbiota, are warranted. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

		<field name="AB">Facing the growing use of nano-manufactured products in many consumer goods, including those from the agro-food sector, the consequences of chronic exposure in humans set public health issues. The oral route of exposure remains largely unknown although a nano-sized fraction of particles is found in food additives/supplements or incorporated into packaging in contact with food. Once ingested, nanoparticles may transit within the gastro-intestinal tract, be chemically and morphologically transformed, and impact the luminal environment before crossing the epithelial barrier and distributing to the systemic compartment. This review focuses on nano-silver and nano-titanium dioxide. Despite their specificities and differences, a close relationship exists between physico-chemical reactivity and bioavailability/biopersistence within the gut. Few data are to date reported on the interactions between nano-silver/nano-titanium dioxide, microbiota and mucus, which are key players in intestinal homeostasis and host health, with a putative impact on nanoparticle distribution to the systemic compartment.

		<field name="AB">In this study, (-)-epigallocatechin 3-O-(3-O-methyl) gallate (EGCG3&quot;Me) was embedded in nanoparticles assembled from chitosan (CS) and caseinophosphopeptide (CPP), and the anti-obesity effect of EGCG3&quot;Me-loaded chitosan-caseinophosphopeptide (CS-CPP) nanoparticles was investigated. The encapsulation efficiency of EGCG3&quot;Me ranged from 72.61 to 83.25% with EGCG3&quot;Me concentration changing from 1.0 to 2.5 mg/mL, and the in vitro release of EGCG3&quot;Me was controllable. The administration of EGCG3&quot;Me-loaded CS-CPP alleviated the changes in the serum and liver levels of high fat diet-induced obesity human flora-associated mice model dramatically. For the population of the intestinal microbiota, both EGCG3&quot;Me and EGCG3&quot;Me-loaded CS-CPP promoted the growth of certain beneficial bacteria and exhibited inhibitory effects on the proliferation of Bacteroides-Prevotella and Clostridium histolyticum. Furthermore, EGCG3&quot;Me-loaded CS-CPP showed the best proliferative effect on Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus-Enterococcus spp. Together, it confirmed that the encapsulation of EGCG3&quot;Me by nanoparticles can effectively improve the bioactivity of EGCG3&quot;Me and prevent obesity-related metabolic disorders.</field>

		<field name="AB">In the present study, the changes of polysaccharides from Gracilaria rubra (GRPS) under simulated oral, gastric and small intestine digestion conditions were firstly investigated. The results indicated that GRPS was not digested under such conditions. Then, the prebiotic property of GRPS was investigated via in vitro fermentation by human gut microbiota in mixed cultures. The results showed that GRPS was gradually degraded and utilized by gut microbiota. With the proceeding of fermentation, pH kept a downward trend and the concentration of short chain fatty acids increased, especially acetic, propionic and isobutyric acids. Furthermore, GRPS exhibited a modulatory effect on microbial structure by lowering the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes and increasing the relative abundances of bacteria that could degrade GRPS to satisfy the growth of gut microbiota. The results suggested that GAPS had the potential to be developed as prebiotics.</field>

		<field name="AB">The aim was to assess whether citrus pomace increases stool frequency in healthy adults. In this randomised, blinded, controlled trial, healthy adults (62% females) received a beverage containing pomace (473 mL/day, providing 10 g fibre/day, n = 111) or control (n = 110) for 3 weeks. Stool frequency, Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), and Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) scores were self-assessed. 24-h diet recalls were completed once/week. Stool microbiota were analysed by 16S rRNA sequencing and qPCR. Mean total daily fibre intake was higher with pomace vs. control (P &lt; 0.0001). Mean weekly stool frequency was higher, indicating improved laxation, with pomace vs. control (P = 0.0281) and increased from baseline with pomace (P = 0.0003) but was unchanged with control. Mean BSFS scores were higher with pomace vs. control (P = 0.04). GSRS indigestion syndrome scores, specifically symptoms of gas and bloating, were higher with pomace, suggesting fermentation. Pomace intake increased faecal OTUs corresponding to Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae.</field>

		<field name="AB">The blood serum indexes of glucose and lipids, the intestinal microbiota and the production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) were determined in Wistar rats which were fed a standard (AIN-P) diet, a modified standard (AIN-M) diet, and diets containing the following yeast cell wall fractions: insoluble glycan (IG), mannan (M), and a mixture of glycan + mannan (G + M) as the only source of dietary fiber. Fractionation of the cell wall was carried out by means of physicochemical extraction processes, centrifugation, and drying in a &quot;spray dryer&quot;. Serum indexes were dosed by means of commercial kits and the influence of the fractions on the intestinal microbiota and the production of short-chain volatile fatty acids (VFA) were carried out by collecting intestinal contents (colon, cecum, and rectum). Considering the cholesterol levels at time zero (T-0) and at time 28 (T-28), diets AIN-P AIN-M, and M presented a hypocholesterolemic effect considering the hypercholesterolemic nature of the diets. Regarding serum glucose, at the onset of the experiment (TO), a general increase in glycemia was observed which suggests a hyperglycemic effect of the examined diets. The G+M diet yielded the highest significant values of serum lipids at T-14 and the lowest values were found in the M diet and the IG diet at T-14 and in the AIN-M and AIN-P diets. The AIN-P diet yielded the highest significant values of triacylglycerols at T-14 and T-28. The lowest levels at T-14 were found in the G + M and IG diets and at T-28 for the AIN-M and M diets. In general, there were no significant modifications in the intestinal microbiota of the rats in any diet. Regarding the VFA, the acetic acid was predominant, followed by the propionic and butyric acids in all the tested diets.</field>

		<field name="AB">To analyze the differences in the composition of the intestinal microbiota between the autistic and healthy children, we selected 45 autistic and 20 control children aged 2 to 9 years to collect their fecal samples. The total microbial genome DNA of each fecal sample was extracted, and the V3 regions of microbial 16S rRNA genes were amplified. The intestinal microbial composition of both study groups was detected by PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Quantity One and Biodap software were used to analyze the diversity and similarity of bacterial populations, and SPSS software was used for statistical analysis. The denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis profiles documented significant differences in the composition of intestinal microflora between the autism and control groups. Analysis of the excised bands demonstrated the abundance of bacteria species assigned to the genus Escherichia/Shigella in the gastrointestinal tract of the autism group but a low content in the control group. An opposite result was obtained for the Bacteroides genus. These data indicate that intestinal microbial composition may is correlated with the occurrence of the autism.</field>

		<field name="AB">Gut dysbiosis has been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of energy metabolic disorders and might be a new strategy for these ailments. Berberine (BBR), a botanical medicine, shows therapeutic efficacy in patients with metabolic diseases. Numerous reports have shown BBR's modulating effect on gut microbiota, opening a new avenue to understand BBR's mechanism. In this study, a colon-specific delivery system, BBR-CS/PT-NP, is investigated by the assembly of pH/gut microflora dual stimuli-responsive nanoparticles for enhancing the interaction between BBR and gut microbiota. After oral administration, the delivering system remains stable in the stomach and small intestine, followed by a burst release of BBR after reaching the colon segment rich in intestinal bacteria. The enzymes produced by bacteria degrade the nanoparticle, causing direct exposure of BBR to gut microbiota. In the high fat diet-induced obese hamsters, BBR-CS/PT-NP intervention inhibits weight-gain and fat deposition, decreases plasma lipids and glucose levels, improves inflammation condition and insulin resistance, alleviates hepatic steatosis, at a level significantly higher than the pure BBR does. The mechanisms might be attributable to the enhanced interaction between BBR and the gut flora. The results provide a novel proof-of-concept for drug delivery targeting gut microbiota to ameliorate metabolic disorders.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background The breakdown of dead organic matter is driven by a diverse array of organisms and is an important process increasingly impacted by a range of contaminants. While many studies have documented how contaminants affect food webs that are fueled by decaying plant litters, much less is known about how contaminants affect organisms that rely on dead animal material. Here, we begin to explore the effects of food contamination-using silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as a model contaminant-on the carrion beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides that buries carcasses of small vertebrates in soils as food source and larval nursing grounds. Results Our data show that a single ingestion of a non-lethal dose of 1 mu g mL(-1) AgNPs by adult female beetles does not affect overall gut microbial activity but results in shifts in the gut microbial community composition towards pathogens including Alcaligenes, Morganella, and Pseudomonas. While no effects were observed in offspring clutch size, some reductions were visible in clutch weight, number of larvae, and number of eclosing pupae in exposed N. vespilloides in comparison with controls. Repeated ingestion of AgNPs over several weeks led to a decrease in survival of adult beetles, suggesting that more environmentally realistic exposure scenarios can directly affect the success of carcass-feeding animals. Conclusions Sub-lethal carcass contamination with a model pollutant can affect the gut microbial composition in female beetles and reduce offspring fitness. This encourages consideration of currently overlooked propagation routes of contaminants through necrophagous food webs and inherent consequences for ecological and evolutionary processes.</field>

		<field name="AB">Nanotechnology is an attractive and challenging science focused on the materials at nanoscale level and their employment in a wide variety of applications. Its applications in (nano)medicine are constrained due to the main concerns in understanding and predicting the behavior of nanoparticles (NPs) in complex biological fluids. The properties of NPs can be strongly influenced by the surrounding conditions, such as pH and composition, in terms of aggregation status, chemical reactivity and surface chemistry. In this regard, this review intents to provide some insight into the performance of complex biological fluids associated with nanomaterials. In particular, the behavior of AgNPs and AuNPs in simulated biological fluids that must be addressed to develop an appropriate system for medical applications, from a chemical perspective, mostly related to the physico-chemical characteristics of NPs and simulated biological fluids and their possible interactions (mechanisms) was considered. Furthermore, the fate of AgNPs and AuNPs during the gastrointestinal transit from an in vivo experimental perspective, as well as their potential impact on gut microbiota was also systematized.</field>

		<field name="AB">Phthalates are ubiquitous in the environment due to widespread production and distribution. The carcinogenic compounds dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) are non-covalently bonded to plastics; thus prone to dispersal in various environments. Phthalates not only sorb to riverine sediments, but are also taken up by a variety of aquatic organisms. Asian carp species silver (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) and bighead (Hypophthaltnichthys nobilis) are exposed to phthalates by ingestion and absorption.,The biodegradation of phthalates has been extensively investigated; however, no studies have isolated phthalate degrading bacteria from aquatic species. The purpose of this study was to characterize the growth and biodegradation kinetics of phthalate-degrading bacteria isolated from the gut, gill, and scale microbiomes of Asian carp, and riverine sediments. 16S rRNA sequencing identified similar genera in sediment and H. molitrix gut microbiome inoculated phthalate enrichments. Achromobacter aegrifaciens strain SKTGEO1 and Pseudomonas japonica strain SKEO1 were enriched from sediments; Bacillus subtilis strain SK18, Pseudomonas putida strain SKTG1, and Consortium SK-1 were enriched from Asian carp microbiomes. Each bacteria isolated was shown to eliminate phthalates from experimental systems. This is the first study documenting the biodegradation of phthalates by bacteria isolated from Asian carp gut and H. molitrix scale microbiomes.</field>

		<field name="AB">Soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities are essential for nitrogen cycling. Large amounts of silver nanoparticles released into the environment (especially farmlands) can dramatically affect soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities. Thus, high-throughput sequencing technology was implemented to address the ecotoxicological effects of silver nanoparticles with different particle sizes and concentrations on soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities in the wheat rhizosphere. Soil pH value is inversely related to the diversity of soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities likely mediated by the changes in nutrient availability in the soil subsystems. AgNPs. Silver nanoparticles with 30 nm significantly decrease the diversity of soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities compared with the control. The decreased diversity of soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities can reduce the soil nitrogen availability for wheat via the decreased nifH gene abundance. Treatments with silver nanoparticles and silver ions significantly increase soil silver ion concentration compared with the control. Thus, the inhibition of silver nanoparticles on soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities is presumably due to the released silver ions. Silver ions pose a stronger inhibition on the diversity and richness of soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities compared with silver nanoparticles. The inhibition of silver nanoparticles on the diversity and richness of soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities increases as the particle size decreases. The concentration of silver nanoparticles does not exert notable effects on the alpha and beta diversity of soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities. Accordingly, particle size, rather than concentration, is the most important determinant of the inhibition of silver nanoparticles on soil N-2-fixing bacterial communities.</field>

		<field name="AB">The ubiquitous accumulation of microplastic (MP) particles across all global ecosystems accompanies their uptake into soil food webs. In this review, we analyzed studies on passive translocation, active ingestion, bioaccumulation and adverse effects within the phylogenetic tree of multicellular soil faunal life. The representativity of these studies for natural soil ecosystems was assessed using data on the type of plastic, the shape, the composition, the concentration and the time of exposure. Available studies cover a wide range of soil organisms, with emphasis on earthworms, nematodes, springtails, beetles and lugworms, each focused on well-known model organisms. Thus, about 58 % of the studies used inappropriate concentrations or units, whereas 42 % applied MP concentrations similar to amounts in slightly to very heavily polluted soils. In many cases, however, polystyrene microspheres were used, which represent a combination of plastic type and shape that is easily available but does not reflect the main plastic input into soil ecosystems. In turn, MP fibers are strongly underrepresented compared with their high abundance within contaminated soils. A few studies also examined the comminution of macroplastic by the soil fauna. Further properties of plastic such as aging, coating and additives have been insufficiently documented. Despite these limitations, there is a recurring pattern of active intake followed by a population shift within the gut microbiome and adverse effects on motility, growth, metabolism, reproduction and mortality in various combinations, especially at high concentrations and small particle sizes. For the improvement of future studies, we identified the problems with past experiments, and we recommend that coming studies consider the type, shape, grade of aging, specific concentrations of MP fractions and long-term incubation in both natural and contaminated soils.</field>

		<field name="AB">Brown algae contain soluble polysaccharides, such as alginic acid, fucoidan and laminaran. To assess the induction of dietary fiber-fermenting bacteria in the intestine, rats were fed diet containing no dietary fiber (control) or 2% w/w of the polysaccharides for 2 weeks. The levels of dietary fiber-fermenting bacteria in caecal contents were determined using decimal dilution culture containing 1% w/v of the fibers. Caecal microbiota in the rats was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). In the culture method, 4-9 log viable cells/g caecal content of alginate-fermenting bacteria was detected in rats fed alginate, while this was not detected in rats fed the control diet. Although laminaran-fermenting bacteria were detected in control rats (4-9 log viable cells/g), the level observed in rats fed laminaran was 8 or 9 log viable cells/g. On the other hand, fucoidan-fermenting bacteria were not detected in rats fed fucoidan. DGGE analysis showed laminaran administration increased the diversity of bacterial bands. Clostridium spp. and Parabacteroides distasonis were detected as typical species in rats fed alginate and laminaran. The results indicate that the intake of soluble fermentable fibers in edible brown algae can alter the intestinal microbiota and its fermentation capacity. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

		<field name="AB">Since two decades, the nanotechnologies have focused many attention, with revolutionary promises including in medicine. In the agri-food industry, applications are growing, ranging from phytosanitary products to ingredients incorporated in foodstuffs or in food packaging. Mineral or organic nanoparticles (dimension between 1 and 100 nanometers) provide tenfold properties compared to conventional materials. However, whether being manufactured and intentionally added along the food chain, or generated during food processing, nanoparticles are suspected of posing a risk to human health. The size effect allows these agents to pass biological barriers and diffuse into the body, to accumulate in the systemic organs where their high chemical reactivity can be a source of toxicity. Faced with new applications in food, oral exposure to these products represents a new challenge in toxicology. (C) 2018 Societe francaise de nutrition. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

		<field name="AB">The effect of novel synthetic polysaccharides such as polydextrose and galactoglucomannan to host physiology has not been well studied. This study was conducted to test the impact of synthetic polysaccharides on lipid metabolism, antioxidant activity, and the composition of gut microbiota of mice fed with high-fat diet (HFD). The results showed that HFD supplemented with polysaccharides induced positive effects in relation to serum endotoxin, blood glucose, serum and liver lipids, decreased fat accumulation and Lee obesity index, and reduced liver adipose steatosis. Fifteen week treatment with polysaccharides significantly decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TSARS), and increased total antioxidant capacity and the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. The polysaccharides improved gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by HFD, including increasing the Bacteroidetes-to-Firmicutes ratios, significantly inhibiting the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, and promoting proliferation of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli. Furthermore, polysaccharides significantly increased the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in vitro. Thus, synthetic polysaccharides can be used as potential functional foods. Moreover, it can sufficiently decrease the risk of obesity and restore liver redox status under oxidative stress conditions mediated by HFD possibly by regulating gut microbes and increasing acetate, propionate, and butyrate.

		<field name="AB">Despite extensive studies on the toxicity of antibacterial silver (either ionic Ag+ or nanoparticles - AgNPs) at the cellular or organism level, little is known about the differences in toxicity at the community level, especially regarding the gut microbiota. In the present study, we applied 16S rRNA sequencing, metatranscriptome sequencing and gut microbiota transplants (GMTs) to investigate the gut-microbial adaptation and transformation of different silver (Ag) forms over 4 generations of exposure of Daphnia magna to environmentally relevant concentrations of Ag+ and AgNPs. Our results demonstrated that the gut-accumulated Ag+ and AgNPs were transformed by gut microbial sulfidation, which subsequently affected the toxic symptoms of D. magna. Multi-generational exposure revealed that selection of the toxicity-adapted gut microbiota was both Ag form- and exposure time- dependent, resulting in a distinctive gut-microbial community between generations and treatments. Specifically, the expression of gut microbial genes for sulfide synthesis and organic matter degradation was simultaneously expressed when encountering Ag challenge and was positively correlated with the reduced toxic symptoms. The reciprocal GMTs further illustrated that the Ag+- and AgNP-adapted gut microbiota were unable to fully acclimate to the toxicity of other Ag forms, resulting in a dramatic community shift and aggravated toxic symptoms of recipient D. magna. Toxic differences between Ag+ and AgNPs were related to the enriched organic matter in the gut, which functioned as an electron donor for sulfidation-based detoxification of Ag+ through degradation and as an inhibitor of Ag+ release from AgNPs by surface adsorption. Our findings provided fundamental understanding about gut-microbial detoxification and transformation of Ag+ and AgNPs, which finally resulted in physiological changes of D. magna and their offspring.</field>

This study examines the effect of modified citrus pectin and encapsulated probiotic, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 on colon lactobacilli microbiota in healthy Balb/c mice. Mice were orally administered once daily with modified citrus pectin alginate probiotic, alginate calcium probiotic, modified citrus pectin and water for 28 days. Faecal lactobacilli count were determined using automated colony counter Doc-It (R) imaging station. The number of faecal lactobacilli in the modified citrus pectin alginate probiotic-treated mice significantly increased at day 7, 14 and 28 [7.99 +/- 0.22, 8.32 +/- 0.08 and 8.36 +/- 0.23 ( log(10)cfu/g) respectively]. A little or no increase in the faecal lactobacilli count was noted in the modified citrus pectin-treated mice. Modified citrus pectin alginate combined with live probiotic, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 supplements can be used as probiotic therapy to improve the intestinal lactobacilli microbiota in healthy host.</field>

		<field name="AB">Ophiopogonis Radix (Maidong in Chinese), the tuberous roots of Ophiopogon japonicus having polysaccharide as the main active ingredient, is a traditional Chinese herb and popularly used as functional food additive in China. Here, a homogeneous polysaccharide fraction (OJP-W1) was isolated and characterized from Ophiopogonis Radix collected from Sichuan (Chuan-Maidong). The therapeutic effects of OJP-W1 in diabetes symptoms, gut microbiota and metabolism of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced type-2 diabetes mice were investigated. Results showed that OJP-W1 significantly ameliorated HFD-induced insulin resistance and glucose tolerance. Meanwhile, OJP-W1 regulated the gut microbiota dysbiosis in HFD-fed mice, as indicated by increasing Actinobacteria and Bifidobacterium, decreasing Proteobacteria and type-2 diabetes-enriched taxa (e.g. Desulfovibrionaceae, Dorea and Ruminococcaceae). In addition, OJP-W1 could improve the metabolic disorder of SCFAs in HFD-fed mice. This study indicated that OJP-W1 might serve as a novel functional food in preventing diabetes-associated gut microbiota dysbiosis and SCFA metabolic disorder.</field>

		<field name="AB">Graphene oxide (GO) suspensions can act as a good dispersant and drug delivery system for effective dispersion and drug sustained release. In this study, we investigated the impact of GO on blood/liver lipids and gut microbiota structure in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hyperlipidemic mice. Oral administration of GO for 28 days remarkably decreased the lipid levels in blood and liver. GO did not decrease the total number of gut bacteria but increased the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria such as Clostridium clusters IV and Allobaculum spp. GO also enhanced the copying of bacterial butyryl coenzyme A transferase (BcoA), a key butyrate-producing gene. Although further pharmacological studies are still needed, these results provided an interesting hint that GO may exert beneficial effects on the host's metabolism via selective modulation of SCFA-producing gut microbes.</field>

		<field name="AB">The effects of whole foods and food components on gut microbiota are often investigated in animal models not fed a human-type background diet. In this study, rats were fed basal starch (BS) or quasi human (QH) background diets either unsubstituted (controls) or substituted with inulin, dried kiwifruit or pectin for 28 days. Gut microbiota composition and hydrated faecal bulking potential of the diets were evaluated. In the caecum and colon, relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum, family or genus levels differed considerably between the background diets (BS and QH). Rats fed QH diets had higher Actinobacteria than those rats fed BS diets. Gut microbiota responses to inulin, kiwifruit and pectin depended on the background diet. QH diet led to twice the mass of hydrated faecal bulk than BS diet. Overall, simple laboratory animal diets are unlikely to provide valid predictions of effects of prebiotics added to human diets.</field>

		<field name="AB">Polyphenols have various potentially beneficial effects on human health. However, the positive bioactivities depend on the bioavailability and bioaccessibility of polyphenols since many polyphenols are rapidly metabolized upon oral administration. Starch can interact with polyphenols and delivery them through the digestive tract. After physicochemical or enzymatic modification, the starch-based carriers can sustained-release or targeted-release polyphenols. The aim of this review is to discuss recent literature about impacts of bioactive polyphenols and starch on gut microbiota and the encapsulation of polyphenols by starch. Starch can control the polyphenol amount released in the upper digestive tract, thereby potentially protecting polyphenols to reach the lower parts of the digestive tract and alter abundance and composition of gut microbiota.</field>

		<field name="AB">The aim of this study was to compare microbial exposures between rural and urban living environments and find their impact on intestinal microbiota in early infancy. 38 healthy rural term and 37 healthy urban infants were enrolled into this study. Information about living environment-related factors was collected with repeated questionnaires. Dust samples were collected from baby's living rooms and feces samples were collected at 1 month of age. After bacterial DNA extraction and examination by PCR of 16S rDNA V3 Region, bacterial community profilings were obtained by use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Quantity One and Biodap softwares were used for diversity and similarity analysis, and SPSS software was used for statistical analysis. Lifestyles associated with improved hygiene were significantly different in rural and urban regions (P &lt; 0.05). The microbial exposure in rural living environments was significantly higher as compared to the Stripe number (S'), Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index (H'), Pielou Index (E) and Simpson index (D) in the urban group (P &lt; 0.05). The Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index (H') and Pielou Index (E) for the rural intestinal microbiota were significantly higher than those of the urban group (P &lt; 0.05). The Stripe number (S') and Simpson index (D) for the rural intestinal microbiota were slightly higher than those of the urban group means, although the differences between them were not significant (P &gt; 0.05). The structures of both environmental bacteria and intestinalmicrobiota were more similar in the same region. There were significantly positive leaner correlations between the environmental microbial exposures and intestinal microbiota in the Stripe number (S') and Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index (H') (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the rural and urban living environments, especially microbial exposures, are significantly different and this difference can influence the intestinal microbiota in early infancy.</field>

		<field name="AB">Three microwave-synthesized non-digestible oligosaccharides (polydextrose, polygalactose and polymannose) were fermented using an in vitro pH-controlled batch incubation inoculated with human fecal slurries, simulating the events in the distal colon. Microbial changes and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and gas chromatography, respectively. Polydextrose and polygalactose significantly (P &lt; 0.05) stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium suggesting prebiotic potential activities. Besides, polygalactose increased the abundance of the Lactobacillus, while polymannose remarkably (P &lt; 0.05) stimulated the growth of Erysipelotrichaceae. Our results also revealed that the fermentation of polygalactose by gut microbiota produced the largest amount of SCFAs which was dominated by the acetate and propionate as compared to polydextrose and polymannose. In addition, more butyrate was produced from polydextrose. These results suggest that microwave-synthesized polydextrose, polygalactose, and polymannose are potential promising non digestible oligosaccharides in modulating human gut microbiota.</field>

		<field name="AB">Titanium dioxide (TiO2), frequently used in foods, coatings, pigments, and paints, accounts for a major fraction of engineered nanomaterials released from products during usage. Impacts of food and industrial grade TiO2 on the composition and phenotype of a human gut microbiota, representing an upstream anthropogenic system, were studied to elucidate systemic perturbations to the microbial community. Findings show an inhibition of an expected, natural shift in microbial composition observed during control conditions from Proteobacteria to Firmicutes phyla in the presence of both types of TiO2 particles, with food grade exposures having a greater effect. Additionally, both TiO2 exposures resulted in lower values of the colonic pH (&lt;5) as compared to the control (&gt;5), with food grade exposures recording the largest reduction (approximate to pH 4). Similar trends in microbial community hydrophobicity and electrophoretic mobility between baseline, food, and industrial grade exposures indicate TiO2 exposures may have little effect on microbial stability. Results of this study indicate that inherent physical and chemical properties of the two TiO2 forms may indeed produce different microbial responses, which is significant when considering environmental exposure and risk, and the design of environmental fate and toxicity studies.</field>

		<field name="AB">Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2-NPs) are commonly used as food additives, including some high-fat foods that are risk factors for obesity. However, little is known about the effects of chronic TiO2-NPs digestion in the population on high fat diet (HFD). Herein, we reported that TiO2-NPs exacerbated HFD-induced obesity by disruption of mucus layer and alterations of gut microbiota. Oral intake of TiO2-NPs significantly increased body weight, liver weight, and amount of adipose tissues, especially in HFD-fed mice. Mechanistic studies revealed TiO2-NPs induced colonic mucus layer disruption and obesity-related microbiota dysbiosis. The damage on mucus was demonstrated through down-regulation of Muc2 gene and the absorption of mucin protein by TiO2-NPs. Consequently, mucus layer damage combined microbiota dysbiosis escalated the low-grade systemic inflammation, which exacerbated HFD-induced obesity. In contrast, gut microbiota depletion eliminated these effects, indicating gut microbiota were necessary for TiO2-NPs-induced inflammation and obesity. All the results stated the alarming role of TiO2-NPs in the HFD-driven obesity and emphasized the reevaluating the health impacts of nanoparticles commonly used in daily life, particularly, in susceptible population.</field>

In addition, protein, ferulic acid and acetyl groups may be found on some sources of pectin. While pectin has positive health effects against many diseases related to inflammation and as a delivery vehicle for bioactives for colon targeted delivery, conflicting results are reported and may be related to paucity of physico-chemical information or source of pectin. Pectin structure can be enzymatically or chemically modified to produce molecular fragments that can be used to successfully entrap phytochemicals for emulsion based targeted delivery to the colon. Likewise, charge modified pectin allows the development of delivery systems based on hydrogel technology. Pectin is recognized as a soluble dietary fiber, and likely has multiple outcomes against cardiovascular disease. More recent evidence also points to the role of neutral sugars, arabino-oligosaccharides, and ferulic acid and other phenolics associated with pectin as a dietary fiber and in vitro fermentability of selected domains of pectin and associated colonic metabolites on inflammation and gut health. While the mechanism of the positive effects of pectin remain to be elucidated, emerging evidence points to synergism between specific domains of pectin structure and other food constituents.

		<field name="AB">Many functional food ingredients improve intestinal barrier function through their colonic fermentation products short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Effects of individual SCFAs have been well studied, but the effects of SCFA mixtures-colonic fermentation products have been rarely investigated. Therefore, this study used an EnteroMix semi-continuous model to simulate the colonic fermentation of three widely used food ingredients, polydextrose, lactitol and xylitol in vitro, and investigated the effects of their fermentation products on impaired colonic epithelial barrier function through a mucus-secreting human HT29-MTX-E12 cell model. Fermentation of polydextrose and lactitol produced mainly acetate, while fermentation of xylitol produced mainly butyrate and resulted in a much higher butyrate proportion. All fermentation products significantly improved intestinal barrier repairing as measured by increased transepithelial electrical resistance and decreased paracellular permeability. Among these, xylitol fermentation products exhibited better repairing effects than that of polydextrose and lactitol. Correlation analysis showed that the repairing effects were attribute to butyrate but not acetate or propionate, implying that in the fermentation products butyrate may play a major role in improving intestinal barrier function. Our results suggest that functional food ingredients that mainly produce butyrate during fermentation may be of more value for improving gut health related to chronic diseases.</field>

		<field name="AB">Glyphosate is the main component of many broadly used herbicides due to its safety for humans and animals. It is known that the remains of glyphosate are present in allowable doses in fodders and food products, and, consumrd in low doses, it is found in insignificant amounts in milk, eggs and even in the internal organs (liver, kidneys) of animals. For determining combined impact of glyphosate and the commonest food additives on the composition of microbiota of animals, four groups of laboratory male rats were formed, which during 42 days consumed pure water without any restrictions; 1% aqueous solution of glyphosate; 1% solution of glyphosate in combination with 1% solution of sodium benzoate; 1% solution of glyphosate with 1% solution of saccharin. After killing the animals, 1 g of feces were collected and by serial dilutions with 10-1 to 10-9 sterile physiologic solution, a microbiological analysis was undertaken. Out of each dilution an inoculation of the studied material to the elective growth media was performed, by 0.1 cm(3), then the material was incubated in a thermostat (24-72 hours, temperature 37 degrees C), the results were recorded after 24-72 h. The microorganisms were identified by studying morphological parameters, tinctorial, cultural and enzymic properties. Results are provided in CFU/g (colony-forming unit per gramm) of feces. The impact of glyphosate and glyphosate with food additives led to no changes in the number of Escherichia coli and emergence of this species of microorganism with changed enzymic activity. Also no changes occurred in the number of microorganisms of Bifidobactrium and Lactobacillus spp. Addition of glyphosate, and also glyphosate in combination with saccharin to the diet contributes to broader reproduction of microorganisms of Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Pseudomonas genera. Mixtures of glyphosate and food additives allow conditionally pathogenic yeast-like Candida fungi (Candida glabrata and C. albicans) to spread more widely in the intestine. Significant fluctuations in the number of Enterococcus spp. bacteria genus were observed: by 80 times within range of each of the three experimental groups of rats with addition of herbicide with benzoate and saccharin to the diet.</field>

		<field name="AB">Nanomaterials and nanotechnology have great potential in the biological and biomedical field. Recent studies reveal that many nanomaterials possess antibacterial activities. While most of these studies focus on the ability of nanomaterials to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria in vitro, few of them test the effects of nanomaterials on intestinal commensal bacteria. Here, we report that TiO2 nanoparticles (10, 50 and 100 nm in size) can inhibit the growth of Drosophila intestinal commensal bacteria in vitro. This activity depends on the dosage or size, but is independent of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanoparticles. Surprisingly, dietary TiO2 nanoparticles of the same dosage fail to display similar effects in Drosophila larvae or adults. These flies show a normal amount of intestinal commensal bacteria, as well as a normal developmental cycle, energy store, and locomotor activity. These results imply that the antibacterial effect of TiO2 nanoparticles differs in vitro and in vivo.</field>

		<field name="AB">Herbicides and food additives are included in many food products for humans. Non-used products or products beyond their expiry date are deposited in places of utilizatioin of solid municipal wastes, where they can take effects on the organisms of mouse-like rodents. Among the herbicides, glyphosphate takes first place in the world for volume of production, and is the most intensely used in agricultural farming. The discussion about negative impact on the organisms of mammals, especially against the background of using various substances and environmental factors, continues. In this study, we determined the combined effect of glyphosphate and food additives on the organism of laboratory animals, which manifested in changes in body weight, condition and indices of mass of the internal organs and blood parameters. Four groups of laboratory male rats were formed, which over 42 days received: unlimited access to clean water, 1% aqueous solution of glyphosate; 1% solution of glyphosphate and 1% solution sodium benzoate; 1% solution of glyphosphate with 1% solution of saccharin. Glyphosphate and glyphosphate with sodium benzoate and saccharin significantly reduced the daily increases in body weight of animals compared to the control group. The studied substances have notable suppressive effect on the immune system and haematopoiesis in general, which is manifested in reduce of relative mass of the thymus and spleen against the background of increase in the amount of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The inhibition of haematopoiesis is indicated by decrease in the amount of erythrocytes, neurophils and hemoglobin of blood of animals from the experimental groups. The impact on the digestive system of glyphosphate and food additives is indicated by occurance of the effect of &quot;initation&quot; of mucous membranes, and, as a result, disorders in absorption followed by the disorder in metabolic processes. A dysbalance occurs in enzymic systems of the organism, which is manifested in distrophic processes, especially in the liver parenchyma, indicated by the activity of blood enzymes (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase), total number and ratio of proteins of blood plasma. We determined the impact of glyphosphate and its mixes with benzoate and saccharin on the pancreas, which manifests in severe pancreatitis with steep increase in the level of glucose of blood. The results of the study allow us to state that mixture of glyphosphate and food additives can cause toxic effect in animals and humans, which often contact with herbicides.</field>

		<field name="AB">Citral is a monoterpenoid found in the essential oils of several plant species, recognized as a safe diet additive and extensively used in the food and cosmetic industries. This study evaluated the effects of dietary supplementation with citral (0.25 g/kg), loaded in nanosystems or unloaded on the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) pH, hepatosomatic and intraperitoneal fat index, innate immune responses and gut microbiota (GM) of silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen). The treatments were: control diet (CO), diet containing unloaded citral (UC), diet containing citral-loaded nanoemulsions (NE), and diet containing citral-loaded alginate nanoparticles (NP). After 21 days fish fed all diets containing citral showed an increased liver lysozyme activity, whereas fish fed UC showed reduced serum hemolytic activity and intestinal myeloperoxidase activity. Serum lysozyme activity was lower in fish fed diet containing NP, whereas fish fed NE showed a reduced blood macrophage phagocytic index. Citral reduced stomach pH (all delivery forms) and increased intestinal pH when loaded in NE. Both NE and NP reduced the total bacterial population in the fish intestine, whereas Aeromonas spp. in intestine were higher in fish fed diet containing NP. Citral modulated the silver catfish immune responses, GIT pH and GM in a delivery mode-dependent manner.</field>

		<field name="AB">A food product matrix and functional additives used to manufacture it are one of the key factors influencing the fermentation processes in the intestine and the bioavailability of minerals. The aim of this study was to analyse he effect of acidified and non-acidified milk gels with highly-purified (1-3)-, (1-3)(1-4)-, and (1-3)(1-6)-beta-glucan on: gastrointestinal tract parameters, intestinal metabolic activity, and bioavailability of minerals in growing rats. Concentrations of ammonia, short-chain volatile fatty acids as well as bacterial enzyme activity, blood biochemistry, and bioavailability of Ca, Zn, Mn and Fe were significantly affected by beta-glucan structure. The availability of minerals was higher upon the use of branched beta-glucans. Milk gel acidity significantly influenced body weight gain, activity of faecal bacterial enzymes, blood levels of triglycerides and glucose, and bioavailability of all investigated mineral compounds. The use of branched beta-glucans resulted in the most and least intense fermentation processes in the caecum, respectively.</field>

		<field name="AB">The objective of this work was to release bound phenolic compounds (PC) from chickpea by the interaction of the microbiota of a volunteer and to identify the enzymes implied to deliver these PC. The highest amount of PC was released at 12 and 24 h (16.8-18.5 mg GAE/g). Higher antioxidant capacity was observed in these hours through 2,20-azino-bis-(3ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, ferric reducing antioxidant power and 2,' 2.Azobis (2 methylpropionamidine) techniques. Escherichia, Klebsiella, Bacteroides and Veillonella were some genera identified in the microbiota implied in delivered PC. The principal PC identified by ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were flavonoids. Proteomic analysis identified hundreds of proteins from the intestinal microbiota after 12 h of fermentation, including enzymes related to the release of bound PC from chickpea such as pectin esterase. Therefore, this enzyme could be used in other food sources for the release of PC bound to the food matrix and thus take advantage of their bioactive benefits.</field>

		<field name="AB">The Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) reviewed (i) the copper requirements of food-producing and pet animals, (ii) the copper concentration in feed materials and complete feed, (iii) the copper bioavailability, and (iv) the calculated background copper concentration of complete feed. Also considered were (i) the influence of dietary copper on gut microbiota profile and on the bacterial antibiotic resistance in target animals and (ii) the environmental occurrence of bacterial heavy metal tolerance (copper resistance) and resistance to certain antibiotics. The data collected supported the possibility of a reduction in some of the currently authorised maximum contents (CAMC) for total copper in feed. The EFSA Panel developed an algorithm to derive newly proposed maximum contents (NPMC) from the requirement and the native dietary copper content. The NPMC (mg Cu/kg complete feed) comprised of maintained (m), decreased (d) and increased (i) values: 15 for bovine before the start of rumination (m), 30 for other bovine (d), 35 for caprine (i), 15 for ovine (m), 50 for crustacean (m) and 25 for other animal species ((d) for piglets up to 12 weeks, (m) for all other species). The NMPC support health, welfare and economic productivity of target animals, except piglets; performance of weaned piglets would be impacted. The NPMC values would not likely have any consequences on the consumers' intake of copper and are of no concern for the safety of the consumer. The reduction from 170 mg to 25 mg Cu/kg feed piglets would have the capacity to save 1,200 tonnes copper/year being spread in the field and thus, to reduce total copper emissions from farm animal production by about 20%. Thus, the reduction of the CAMC to the NPMC would have a significant impact on the concentrations of copper in the environment of piggeries. (C) 2016 European Food Safety Authority.

		<field name="AB">Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), the most prevalent commercial nanomaterial products, are widely released into the environment. AgNPs are toxic to various aquatic organisms, but their influence on the aquatic organism's gut microbiota remains unknown. Here, we characterized the bacterial communities in the guts of adult zebrafish treated with AgNPs (10, 33 or 100 mu g L-1 ) for 35 days and also measured the concentration of AgNPs in the zebrafish digestive tract. As expected, dose dependence of AgNP accumulation was observed in the digestive tract, accompanied by decreased overall microbial richness and diversity. To our surprise, however, the effects of the AgNP treatment on the gut microbiota of male and female fish were not the same; furthermore, AgNPs significantly altered the relative composition of the bacterial species in the community harbored in male zebrafish but not in females. This research investigates and compares zebrafish intestinal microbiota after AgNP exposure, pointing to the potential health risk to aquatic organisms from alteration of gut microbiota.</field>

In conclusion, it is clear, from all the available data, that authorized LCS, under the officially prescribed conditions of use, have an interest in human nutrition, albeit modest but significant, for a better weight management without any of the deleterious effect they are wrongly suspected.

Results showed that PEC enriched diet significantly increased richness estimator (Chao) of colonic microbiota, relative abundances of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, and decreased Bacteroidetes, whereas INU and RPS induced a roughly similar microbiota composition to the control. PEC changed the expression of genes (CD8A, B2M and CD19) involving antigen processing and presentation, and primary immunodeficiency pathways, and up-regulated 2 active genes (UGT2B31 and LOC100738495) involving the metabolism of important endogenous compounds (e.g. bile acids and steroid hormones). Results indicate that the consumption of apple pectin with high viscosity may lead to a distinct response on microbiota composition and gene expression in pig colons, and result in a potential negative impact on gut health.</field>

		<field name="AB">The health effects of lipids must now be explored beyond their energy content and fatty acid profile. Indeed, fatty acids as unit elements of different molecules such as triacylglycerols and phospholipids are being organized in various supramolecular structures such as emulsion droplets, and incorporated in complex food matrixes. This short article reviews our recent studies on the impact of fat emulsified structure on postprandial lipid metabolism and fatty acid beta-oxidation in normal-weight and obese humans, leading to the concept of &quot;fast versus slow lipids&quot;. We also show how the postprandial kinetics of lipid absorption can contribute to modulate metabolic endotoxemia, partly arising from interactions between dietary lipids and gut microbiota, and able to contribute to metabolic inflammation in obesity. Finally, we highlight the pro-or anti-inflammatory impact in mice of surface active agents used in food formulation to stabilize emulsions, notably phospholipids of vegetal or dairy origin, and different molecular carriers of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The interested reader will refer to our other recent publications and reviews on these topics for a deeper insight into presented concepts.</field>

		<field name="AB">In this study, we aimed to design emulsion system, using pectin as an emulsifier that could resist gastric and intestinal digestion, and deliver tripropionin (glyceryl tripropionate) as propionic acid precursor to the colon. The stability and the degree of lipolysis of the emulsions under in vitro gastrointestinal digestion were assessed using droplet sizing, microscopy, zeta-potential and quantification of tripropionin, propionic acid and pectin coverage. The emulsions were stable in the gastric stage, and the stability under intestinal conditions was dependent on the concentration of pectin. The microscopic structure demonstrated a certain degree of coalescence of all emulsions after intestinal digestion, with the most affected emulsion being that at the lowest pectin concentration. Pectin concentrations of &gt;= 2.5 wt% improved the resistance of the emulsion to coalescence and reduced the rate of lipolysis and the degree of hydrolysis, all of which were due to thicker pectin coverage. This apparently improved the resistance to displacement by bile salts and the subsequent adsorption of colipase and lipase that occur in the initial phase of lipid digestion. The use of pectin to form gastrointestinal-resistant emulsions is a promising approach to delaying the digestion of tripropionin, or other lipid-based materials, and to deliver tripropionin to the colon.</field>

		<field name="AB">Polyol sweeteners, including erythritol and xylitol, have been investigated for their potential in insect control against a number of pests including mosquitoes, fruit flies, ants, and filth flies. Several insecticidal modes of action for the polyols have been proposed in non-biting flies and include: (1) dehydration from excessive regurgitation, (2) arrestment of physiological processes due to abnormally high hemolymph osmolality or osmotic diarrhea, and (3) alteration of the gut microbiome. Here, we explored the proposed modes of action in the house fly, Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), a non-biting fly of medical and veterinary importance. House flies fed erythritol or xylitol regurgitated at a significantly higher rate when compared to flies that ingested sucrose. Flies that ingested sucrose solutions had higher hemolymph osmolality than erythritol but not xylitol, and deposited significantly more fecal spots than flies fed polyol solutions. Cultivable bacteria were least abundant in flies fed solutions of either sucrose or xylitol and most abundant in control flies provided water only. Of the potential modes of action tested, physiological stress from excessive post-feeding regurgitation seems the likeliest cause of death related to polyol consumption. However, we cannot rule out a classical toxicological or biochemical mode of action from these results. Although the efficacy of polyols as active ingredients is still under debate, their use as other components in fly control products may be beneficial. Due to widespread resistance to a limited number of insecticidal chemicals registered for house fly control, it is important that new control chemicals be thoroughly assessed for usefulness.</field>

		<field name="AB">Manufactured nanoparticles, such as CeO2, give rise to novel risks when released into the environment. To assess these risks it is important to quantify the nanoparticle mass flows, as well as their speciation and the mechanisms of their transformation. We developed an innovative dual-radiolabelling strategy for CeO2 nanoparticles using neutron activation and in-diffusion labelling to radiolabel CeO2 nanoparticles with both Ce-141 and Ce-139. The different distribution of the radiolabels in the particles does not only allow easy dose determination in uptake studies but also enables us to track the uptake pathways of the anthropogenic cerium. By measuring the activity as well as the isotope ratio we tracked the uptake, transformation and excretion of CeO2 nanoparticles in freshwater shrimp. We found that 99.99% of the uptaken particles are excreted, leaving the gut with excrement. The remaining 0.01% were internalized via a dissolution-based pathway and accumulated in the hepatopancreas of the shrimp at a dose range of pg CeO2 per shrimp. Most importantly, our results show that dissolution is not only coincidental but instrumental in the uptake of the cerium into the internal organs of the shrimp.</field>

		<field name="AB">Despite the application as additives to control functional properties of food, little is known about the behavior of Sesbania gum (SG) from Sesbania cannabina seeds, in the gastrointestinal tract. SG is a kind of natural and water-soluble galactomannan consisting of a beta-1,4-D-mannan backbone with single alpha-1,6-galactopyranosyl side branching units every 2.4 residues, mass of which is over 10(6) Da. Using in vitro human digestion models, we elucidated the molecular weight changes of SG during the digestion and fermentation and the interactions between SG and gut microbiota. The results showed that the molecular weight of SG was not obviously changed during the simulated saliva, gastric and small intestinal digestion, but was rapidly decomposed and consumed by gut microbiota. As revealed by RNA-seq transcriptome analyses, the CAZyme genes encoded by gut bacteria were significantly up-regulated, especially the families GH5 and 4, which target beta-mannopyranoside and alpha-gal-actopyranoside, respectively. SG degradation led in turn, to changes in the short-chain fatty acid production and microbiota composition as determined by HPLC and 16S-seq, respectively. Our work is helpful to understand some features of SG subjected to the potential digestion and fermentation, and the results suggest SG has potential to be developed as a functional food ingredient for gut health.</field>

		<field name="AB">Pectins are a major dietary nutrient source for the human gut microbiota. The prominent gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was recently shown to encode the founding member (BT1017) of a new family of pectin methylesterases essential for the metabolism of the complex pectin rhamnogalacturonan-II (RG-II). However, biochemical and structural knowledge of this family is lacking. Here, we showed that BT1017 is critical for the metabolism of an RG-II-derived oligosaccharide Delta BT1017oligoB generated by a BT1017 deletion mutant (Delta BT1017) during growth on carbohydrate extract from apple juice. Structural analyses of Delta BT1017oligoB using a combination of enzymatic, mass spectrometric, and NMR approaches revealed that it is a bimethylated nonaoligosaccharide (GlcA-beta 1,4-(2-O-Me-Xyl-alpha 1,3)-Fuc-alpha 1,4-(GalA-beta 1,3)-Rha-alpha 1,3-Api-beta 1,2-(Araf-alpha 1,3)-(GalA-alpha 1,4)-GalA) containing components of the RG-II backbone and its side chains. We showed that the catalytic module of BT1017 adopts an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold, consisting of a central twisted 10-stranded beta-sheet sandwiched by several alpha-helices. This constitutes a new fold for pectin methylesterases, which are predominantly right-handed beta-helical proteins. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that the family is dominated by sequences from prominent genera of the human gut microbiota, including Bacteroides and Prevotella. Our re-sults not only highlight the critical role played by this family of enzymes in pectin metabolism but also provide new insights into the molecular basis of the adaptation of B. thetaiotaomicron to the human gut.</field>

		<field name="AB">The possibility of achieving a 50% of added sugar reduction in chocolate milk using natural non-nutritive sweeteners, namely stevia and monk fruit extract was studied and optimised using response surface methodology. Variables were chosen as stevia sweetener (5-100 ppm) and monk fruit extract (50-100 ppm) based on preliminary trials. Sensory attributes (overall liking, appearance, aroma, sweetness, mouthfeel and aftertaste) were taken as the responses. The process was optimised with a combination of 56.27 ppm of stevia sweetener and 81.90 ppm of monk fruit extract with sensory attributes of 6.78, 6.47, 6.31, 6.47, 6.45 and 6.33, respectively for overall liking, appearance, aroma, sweetness, mouthfeel and aftertaste. Use of the two selected sweeteners in combination resulted in sweetness synergy and the bitter and metallic aftertastes of stevia were masked by the monk fruit extract and helped enhance the overall sensory attributes of the product compared with the control.

		<field name="AB">Purpose gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is recognised as a potential metabolic bioactive food ingredient with increasing evidence of its effects on the gut-brain axis and systemic metabolic health. Different lactic acid bacteria are capable of producing GABA, particularly strains of Lactobacillus brevis. In this study, we characterized a Lb. brevis isolated from traditional alpine cheese (Lb. brevis DSM 32386) for its ability to accumulate high levels of GABA in the culture medium and for other important probiotic phenotypic traits. Methods In vitro analysis were used to study the Lb. brevis DSM 32386 probiotic traits and the gene expression involved in GABA production Result Lactobacillus brevis DSM 32386 converted monosodium glutamate to GABA more efficiently than the type strain Lb. brevis DSM 20054, resulting in more than 200% of GABA produced. This ability seemed to be related to the higher transcriptional activation of the gene encoding for the glutamate (gad) decarboxylase antiporter (gadC) and regulator (gadR). Lactobacillus brevis DSM 32386 performed well in vitro under the stress conditions mimicking the gastro-intestinal tract, being resistant to acid pH (pH 2.5) and growing in simulated pancreatic fluid and 0.3% ox-bile. Conclusion These preliminary studies indicate that Lb. brevis DSM 32386 holds promise as a starter for GABA-rich dairy fermented foods and possibly a promising next-generation probiotic microorganism in the context of the gut (microbiota):brain axis.</field>

		<field name="AB">The objective of this study was enumeration and identification of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from honey bee (Apis mellifera L) and testing their antibacterial activity against different types of bacteria. Dilution method and cultivation in selective media were used for enumeration of LAB, the isolates were identified by their morphological and biochemical characteristics and by genotype method. The antibacterial activity was performed using the agar well diffusion method. The results showed that five isolates of LAB were isolated from Egyptian honey bees intestinal tract. The isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecalis MG890204, Enterococcus faecalis KX073783, Enterococcus faecalis EU594564, Lactobacillus brevis MH191230 and Lactobacillus casei KT273339. The results of antibacterial activity showed that four of LABs had antibacterial activity against clinical pathogenic strains tested. The mechanisms of action are partly shown by elucidating the production of some active compounds like organic acids in different amounts, Lactic, Oxalic, Glutaric, and acetic acids were produced by all LABs. The findings revealed that honey bee has the potential to be a source of new bacteria with probiotic activities in honey bee or as natural food preservatives for the food industry.</field>

		<field name="AB">Nanosafety evaluation is necessary not only for nanomaterials research and development but also as a cornerstone for legal regulation. In this study, we proposed a non-invasive protocol for nanosafety evaluation through feces using metagenomics and metabolomics together with metallomics. Male SD rats were orally exposed to equal amounts of Se (Se(0)NPs, 3.14 or Na2SeO3, 6.28 mu g/kg bw) and were sacrificed after 24 h. 16S rRNA analysis and LC-MS were used to study the impact of different forms of Se on intestinal microbiota and metabolites in fecal samples. ICP-MS and synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were used to study the concentration and transformation of Se in gastrointestinal track and feces. It was found that Se NPs brought less alternation to the composition of intestinal microbiota and metabolites related to inflammation, immunity and gut-brain axis related responses than Na2SeO3 did. Besides, the absorbed Se(0)NPs could be more efficiently converted to organic Se which explained the comparable bioavailability to Na2SeO3. In all, the proposed protocol combined with metagenomics, metabolomics and metallomics in this study can be used for nanosafety evaluation in a non-invasive manner and this may also be used for the screening of the nanosafety of other nanomaterials.

		<field name="AB">Discharge of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into aquatic ecosystems is inevitable due to their vast industrial applications. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of dietary curcumin supplementation against AgNPs toxicity to the gut microbiota of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) including total bacteria count, mesophilic, lactic acid bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae. Nine different treatments including different combinations of dietary AgNPs (0, 0.05 and 0.15 g/kg feed) and curcumin (0, 0.75 and 1.5 g/kg feed) in three respective replicates were designed. The trial was conducted under natural photoperiod condition for 60 days. Samples were taken on days 20, 40 and 60. Our results showed that dietary AgNPs contamination resulted in reduced intestinal bacterial count in a dose dependent manner, however, dietary curcumin inclusion level of 0.75 g/kg remarkably reduced the toxicity of AgNPs to intestinal microflora of common carp at least at 0.05 g/kg AgNPs (p &lt; 0.05). The results also indicated that there were highly significant relationships (p &lt; 0.001) between intestinal microflora count and dietary curcumin and AgNPs concentrations which were dependent upon exposure time. Beta values for different terms of regression equations implied that AgNPs concentration had remarkable effects on different bacteria classes of gut microbiota (-0.75, -0.89, -0.73 and -0.84 for total bacteria, mesophilic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae count, respectively). Conclusively, microflora population change might be assumed as an indication of environmental pollutions in aquatic ecosystems health assessment programs especially for newly emerging nano-materials. We also showed curcumin protected intestinal microflora against feed-born nanosilver particles.</field>

		<field name="AB">Anthocyanins are natural pigments with important biological properties in humans. However, there are limitations to anthocyanins' technological use due to chemical instability. It precludes the use as food additives and also decreases human bioavailability due to gut microbiota modification, showing it is necessary to protect anthocyanins through encapsulation strategies. The objective of this work was to develop nanoparticles based on pectin and lysozyme self-assembling for the encapsulation of anthocyanin-enriched extracts from blackberries (Rubus spp.). The primary anthocyanin identified in the extract was cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (90%) and the nanoparticles' formulation parameters were optimized by response surface methodology. The main results showed a nanocomposite with 198.5 nm, 0.18-polydispersity index, and zeta potential similar to 16.7 mV, with an encapsulation efficiency of 73% and a loading capacity of 15%. The particles were stable in different pH ranges according to the size and zeta potential measurements. The interaction between the compounds was evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier infrared spectral analysis, indicating that the pectin was found on the surface of the nanoparticles. Scanning microscopy analyses revealed invariably spherical morphology. Therefore, the elaborated nanoparticles constitute a viable alternative for the creation of new food additives, or to enrichment foods with bioactive compounds or even to develop new food supplements.</field>

The components, crystallinity and properties were comparatively studied. Furthermore, we evaluated correlations between DF components and their crystallinity, thermal, physicochemical and functional properties. Results showed quinoa DF had highest polyphenol (25.58 mg GAE per 100 g), pectin (4.68%) and cellulose (52.34%) contents, crystallinity value (CV, 30.24%), Delta H (185.53 J g(-1)), water-holding capacity (WHC, 5.35 g g(-1)), alpha-amylase activity inhibition ratio (alpha-AAIR, 13.34%) and glucose absorption capacity (GAC), but lowest protein content (9.78%) and T-p (163.05 degrees C). Mung bean DF had highest lignin content (33.56%), fat adsorption capacity (4.73 g g(-1)), and T-p (176.25 degrees C), but lowest CV (15.26%) and Delta H (132.15 J g(-1)). Correlation analysis showed cellulose content had positive linear correlations with CV, Delta H, WHC, alpha-AAIR and GAC, but a negative correlation with T-p.

		<field name="AB">Citrus pectins are plant cell wall polysaccharides that can be fermented by gut microbiota, which provide beneficial effects for the host through production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between extraction methods (acid, alkali, cellulase, acid + cellulase, and alkali + cellulase), structural characteristics (primary structure and conformation), and in vitro fermentability of orange and grapefruit pectins. We found that alkali + cellulose (P-10 + C)-extracted orange pectin exhibited high yield (25.63%), compact conformation, and favorable fermentation properties. Based on small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, P-10 + C pectin exhibited a compact conformation (Dmax, 15 nm) with a small Rg (7.70 nm) and large Re (4.78 nm), which facilitated SCFA production and promoted beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium) in an in vitro fermentability evaluation. P-10 + C grapefruit pectin also showed good fermentability, although not as good as that of orange pectin. These results demonstrated that the spatial conformation played a very important role in the in vitro fermentability of the extracted pectins. This study would provide new insights into the extraction-structure-fermentability relationship and will aid the food industry in extracting pectin more efficiently and exploiting novel prebiotics for shaping a balanced gut micmbiota and promoting host health.</field>

		<field name="AB">Colonic fermentation of resistant starch provides health benefits to the host. However, physical characteristics of the food matrix could limit the availability of starch and other dietary fibres for microbiota utilization. In this study, the influence of food structural aspects was studied by using cotyledon cells from red kidney beans with different levels of cellular integrity. In-vitro colonic fermentation was conducted in the simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME (R)) where the utilization of starch and other non-starch polysaccharides was investigated along the three colon regions. Results indicate that plant cell integrity modulates nutrient utilization by gut microbiota where higher amounts of starch were delivered to distal regions of the colon in intact samples. Other dietary fibre constituents, such as pectin, were also differentially fermented depending on the level of cellular integrity. Moreover, bean supplementation produced changes in microbiota population favouring the proliferation of Bifidobacterium species.</field>

However, its role on fecal microbiota has not received attention in the last decades. In this study, anaerobic fermentation in vitro and high-throughput sequencing were conducted to investigate effects of standard OPO alone (OPO-A) and OPO-enriched plant-oil formula (OPO-P) on toddler fecal microbiota. The results showed OPO could be efficiently utilized by toddler fecal microbiota. OPO supplementation enhanced the production of short-chain fatty acids and lactic acid by microbiota. Furthermore, OPO promoted the growth of Bifidobacterium whereas inhibited the growth of Enterobacter at different fermentation time when compared with the control group. Besides, OPO supplementation enhanced bacterial diversity. Thus, this study indicated that OPO could modulate the fecal microbiota. The results provided useful information for further exploring the physiological role of OPO on colon, and provided new ideas for application of OPO.</field>

		<field name="AB">The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of early fecal microbiota transplantation on gut development in sucking piglets. A total of 24 3 day-old DLY sucking piglets (2.11 +/- 0.15) kg were randomly divided into four groups (TMP, YMP, RMP and control group (CON)), which were transplanted with intact fecal microbiota of Tibetan pig (TP), Yorkshire pig (YP), Rongchang pig (RP), and without transplantation, respectively. The whole trial lasted for 56 d. The results are as follows: when compared with the YMP and RMP treatments, TMP and CON had a lower diarrhea index (P &lt; 0.05), TMP and CON had higher GLP-2 and ANG4 mRNA abundances in the ileum (P &lt; 0.05), and the TMP had a higher jejunal villus height: crypt depth and a higher colonic GLP-2 mRNA abundance (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, when compared with the YMP and RMP treatments, TMP had an enhanced DMT1 mRNA abundance in the duodenum (P &lt; 0.05), TMP and CON had a greater lactase activity and a higher DMT1 mRNA abundance in the jejunum (P &lt; 0.05), and CON had a higher -GT activity in the jejunum (P &lt; 0.05). The jejunal Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase activity in TMP was higher than that in CON, and the jejunal Na+, K+-ATPase activity in TMP was higher than that in the other three treatments (P &lt; 0.05). Besides, when compared with the YMP and RMP treatments, TMP had a lower MDA content and a higher MUC1 mRNA abundance in the jejunum (P &lt; 0.05); CON had a higher SOD activity in the jejunum (P &lt; 0.05), whereas TMP and CON had a higher butyric acid concentration in the colon and a lower LPS content in the serum (P &lt; 0.05). Finally, when compared with the TMP treatment, the other three treatments had an enhanced IL-10 mRNA abundance in the colon (P &lt; 0.05), YMP and CON had higher counts of Escherichia coli in the colonic digesta (P &lt; 0.05), and the CON had lower counts of Lactobacillus spp in the cecal and colonic digesta (P &lt; 0.05). These data indicated that early transplantation of the fecal microbiota from the Yorkshire pigs and Rongchang pigs to DLY suckling piglets would destroy the gut microbiota balance and thus damage intestinal health.</field>

		<field name="AB">In the present study, we report the formulation, characterization, and in vitro antibacterial and cytotoxicity effects of exopolysaccharide (EPS) stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles (FeONPs) against the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line (A431). EPS is extracted from a spore-forming strain of Bacillus subtilis, VT03, isolated from the gut microbiome of the freshwater fish Oreochromis mossambicus (Tilapia). FTIR, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR spectroscopic studies show the presence of sugar moieties, confirming that EPS might be a glucan. Later, EPS is used as an eco-friendly reducing and stabilizing agent for the formulation of iron oxide nanoparticles (FeONPs). Initially, the generation of nanoscale FeO was confirmed through the formation of a black-coloured precipitate with an absorbance maxima at 250-300 nm in a UV-visible spectrometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) planes clearly confirm that the synthesized FeONPs are in the cubic spinel phase. The morphometric features of the synthesized FeONPs are exclusively studied using electron microscopy (FESEM and HRTEM) which shows spherical FeONPs in sizes ranging between 75-120 nm; the mean size was found to be 106 +/- 12 nm. Additionally, energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), selected area emission diffraction (SAED) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) confirms the purity and homogeneity of the synthesized FeONPs. The vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) technique reveals the presence of both ferro-and antiferromagnetic phases in the EPS-stabilized FeONPs. Further, the inhibitory activity of EPS-stabilized FeONPs against human and fish pathogenic strains such as Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 49140), Aeromonas hydrophila (MTCC 1739), Aeromonas sobria (MTCC 3613) and Aeromonas hydrophila (obtained from OIE Reference Laboratory, C. Abdul Hakeem College, Melvisharam) was assessed. The in vitro cytotoxicity effects of free EPS and EPSstabilized FeONPs were probed in the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431. The IC50 values of EPS and EPS-stabilized FeONPs were found to be 350.18 and 62.946 mu g ml(-1) respectively. Further, acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr) staining of A431 cells at different time intervals clearly distinguishes the live cells and the cells that have undergone apoptotic cell death. In conclusion, our research paves the way for a facile and greener route to synthesize FeONPs at room temperature. On the other hand, this study also proves that the formulated multifunctional hybrid FeONPs have remarkable qualities such as enhanced bioavailability and magnetic properties. This can be developed into a successful theragnostic platform for cancer treatment.</field>

		<field name="AB">Xylooligosaccharides (XOS) are emerging prebiotic carbohydrates with a high potential to promote health and wellness due to their ability to modulate gut microbiota. Their use as a carrier of milk proteins-crosslinked genipin, an innovative natural blue colorant, was examined in this study. Fructooligosaccharides (FOS), a standard prebiotic carbohydrate, and maltodextrin (MD), a standard carrier material, were compared to XOS as wall materials. The effect of the carrier system on the powdered blue colorants was assessed regarding their size, morphology, free-genipin content, blue color intensity, moisture content, water activity, hygroscopicity, water adsorption, and physical structure. Their technological properties as food colorants were evaluated by incorporating in foodstuffs: beijinho, Chantilly, and muffin. XOS exhibited positive effects compared to other carriers evaluated. XOS-based microparticles presented higher free-genipin retention; smaller particle diameter equal to 6.5 +/- 0.4 mu m, and higher blue color intensity. The microparticles produced with XOS were more hygroscopic compared to other carrier matrices. However, similar to FOS and MD, the blue colorant carried with XOS presented an amorphous structure. XOS was the best carrier in food applications due to the less interference on the blue color in the powder colorant. The XOS microparticles could be easily incorporated into some food matrices. Therefore, spray-dried blue colorant using XOS presented significant innovative potential in many food products, acting as a functional ingredient, replacing artificial blue colors, and incorporating prebiotic properties.</field>

		<field name="AB">The imbalance of gut microbiota, such as dysbiotic expansion of Enterobacteriaceae, is strongly associated with the progress of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) via exacerbating gut inflammation and disturbing intestinal mucosal barrier. Recently, a microbiota-based strategy is an attractive paradigm for IBD therapy. Here, we explored the therapeutic potential of tungsten oxide nanoparticles (WO(3)NPs) against DSS-induced acute colitis mice. WO(3)NPs (47.9 nm in diameter) significantly reduced intestinal inflammation, attenuated bacterial translocation, restored the colonic epithelium barriers, and remodeled gut microbiota homeostasis in inflamed colon, compared with the free tungsten (sodium tungstate). The element quantification and mapping results showed WO(3)NPs could increase the adherence of tungsten with Enterobacteriaceae in colonic mucus layer, which inhibited Enterobacteriaceae growth by microbial metabolic reprogramming and ameliorate colitis. This nano-enabled approach for tungsten reduced its deposition in the main organ except for the colon thereby improve the therapeutic efficacy with good biosafety. Together, our results provide insights into the potential nanotherapeutics of WO(3)NPs against the invasion processes of micro biota in the treatment of IBD. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

		<field name="AB">Background: Fruits are the main source of pectin, with more than 90% of commercial pectins being derived from fruit by-products. Fruit pectins are complex heterogeneous polysaccharides that exhibit a variety of physicochemical properties and health functions. Fruit pectins exist in the primary cell walls and middle lamella of plants and are usually crosslinked with cellulose and hemicellulose; their extraction involves hydrolysis, isolation, and solubilization processes. Conventional studies have focused solely on individual extraction methods, structural characteristics, or functional properties, while neglecting the relationships between these factors. Scope and approach: This review systematically summarizes the principles and features of single, i.e., acid, alkali, and enzymatic digestion, and combined, i.e., subcritical water, ultrasound-, microwave-, and ultrasoundmicrowave-assisted, methods for extracting pectins from fruit. We discuss the effects of different extraction methods on the structural characteristics of fruit pectins including molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, degree of esterification, and conformation. The impacts of these structural characteristics on the physicochemical properties and health functions, specifically the regulation of gut microbiota and anti-inflammatory, antiglycation, and immunomodulating effects of fruit pectins are also discussed. Key findings and conclusions: Different extraction methods result in pectins with different structural characteristics. These, in turn, strongly affect the physicochemical properties and health functions of the pectin. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the extraction-structure-property relationships of pectin is crucial to realizing pectin preparations with targeted functional effects.</field>

		<field name="AB">Nanoparticles (NPs) are becoming prevalent in consumer goods, including foods and cosmetics. Understanding the interactions between NPs and bacteria in an engineered model colon can indicate potential impacts of NP exposure on the gut, and therefore overall human health. Human microbiome health has important implications to overall individual health. This work aims at quantifying the phenotypic response to NP ingestion of a model microbial community within a model colon. Three NPs at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.01g/L ZnO, 0.01g/L CeO2, and 3mg/L TiO2) were individually introduced into a model colon to identify the subsequent impact on the gut microbial community. Results indicate that NPs cause the microbial community's phenotype to partition into three distinct phases: initial conditions, a transition period, and a homeostatic phase, with the NP-exposed community displaying significant differences (p&lt;0.05) from the unexposed community in multiple phenotypic traits. Notably, phenotypes, including short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, hydrophobicity, sugar content of the extracellular polymeric substance, and electrophoretic mobility, which indicate changes in the community's stability, were affected by the NPs. TiO2 NPs led to extended phenotypic transformations for hydrophobicity when compared with the other NPs, likely due to its lack of dissociation and greater stability. Overall, the NPs caused nonlethal, significant changes to the microbial community's phenotype, which may be related to overall health effects.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background: engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have already made their way into myriad applications and products across multiple industries. However, the potential health risks of exposure to ENMs remain poorly understood. This is particularly true for the emerging class of ENMs know as 2-dimensional nanomaterials (2DNMs), with a thickness of one or a few layers of atoms arranged in a planar structure. Methods: the present study assesses the biotransformations and in vitro cytotoxicity in the gastrointestinal tract of 11 2DNMs, namely graphene, graphene oxide (GO), partially reduced graphene oxide (prGO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), molybdenum disulphide (MoS2), and tungsten disulphide (WS2). The evaluated pristine materials were either readily dispersed in water or dispersed with the use of a surfactant (Na-cholate or PF108). Materials dispersed in a fasting food model (FFM, water) were subjected to simulated 3-phase (oral, gastric, and small intestinal) digestion to replicate the biotransformations that would occur in the GIT after ingestion. A triculture model of small intestinal epithelium was used to assess the effects of the digested products (digestas) on epithelial layer integrity, cytotoxicity, viability, oxidative stress, and initiation of apoptosis. Results: physicochemical characterization of the 2DNMs in FFM dispersions and in small intestinal digestas revealed significant agglomeration by all materials during digestion, most prominently by graphene, which was likely caused by interactions with digestive proteins. Also, MoS2 had dissolved by similar to 75% by the end of simulated digestion. Other than a low but statistically significant increase in cytotoxicity observed with all inorganic materials and graphene dispersed in PF108, no adverse effects were observed in the exposed tricultures. Conclusions: our results suggest that occasional ingestion of small quantities of 2DNMs may not be highly cytotoxic in a physiologically relevant in vitro model of the intestinal epithelium. Still, their inflammatory or genotoxic potential after short- or long-term ingestion remains unclear and needs to be studied in future in vitro and in vivo studies. These would include studies of effects on co-ingested nutrient digestion and absorption, which have been documented for numerous ingested ENMs, as well as effects on the gut microbiome, which can have important health implications.</field>

		<field name="AB">This work is aimed at the evaluation of transformation of microbiota of Danio rerio intestines and gills under the impact of MoO(3)NPs, which corresponds to the existing level of studies using this model. The composition of the microbial community of Danio rerio was studied after nanoparticles of MoO3 (MoO(3)NPs) were administered into the environment in amount of 0.2 mg/dm(3) within 7 days (Group II), in amount of 0.4 mg/dm(3) within 14 days (Group III) in the form of lyosols with fish feed. MoO(3)NPs were not added to the reference group I; the procedure was comprised of the following: sampling, isolation, cleaning, measurement of DNA concentrations, polymerase chain reaction, validation and normalization of libraries with subsequent sequencing on the basis of high-performance sequenator (MiSeq Illumina, USA). Dose-dependent influence of MoO(3)NPs on microbiota transformation of intestines and gills has been estimated. Nanoparticles modify the composition of the microbiota by reducing the amount of symbionts participating in vital activity of macro-organism. Gills' microbiota is modified to a greater extent, and the increased occurrence of Actinobacteria phylum has been detected with significant difference in Group III. In fish intestines of Group II Cetobacterium somerae is the significant species. In Group III, representatives of Acinetobacter and Staphylococcus genuses have been identified, and the increase in fraction of Gram-positive microflora has been observed. The results evidence the violation of equilibrium in microbiota of intestines and gills and suppression of protecting mechanisms which usually prevent colonization by foreign microflora. Penetration of MoO(3)NPs into organism can influence the fish intestinal and respiratory systems and health.</field>

Prebiotics can be produced from natural sources synthesised from natural ingredients. Among the best established health benefits of prebiotics are their improvement of bowel function and improved mineral uptake. Specific probiotic strains have been shown shorten the duration of rotavirus diarrhoea and modulate the immune system.

		<field name="AB">In the current study, we modified the surface of Tb(OH)(3) nanoparticles with a silica layer to enhance their solubility and biocompatibility. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the improvements in these properties. Tb(OH)(3)@SiO2 core-shell nanoparticles (TS-CSNPs) exhibited a strong green emission peak upon irradiation with ultraviolet light, which originates from the electric-dipole transition D-5(4) -&gt; F-7(5) (543 nm) of the Tb3+ ion. In vitro anticancer and antimicrobial activities of the synthesized TS-CSNPs has been evaluated through their potential cytotoxicity and antibacterial activity. TS-CSNPs were shown to have more cytotoxicity against HT29 human colorectal cancer cells with a value of IC50 420.33 in an MTT assay. The alteration of the morphological features of HT29 cells was analysed using various concentrations of TS-CSNPs by inverted microscopy. Western blot analysis results of the apoptotic pathway showed that TS-CSNPs inhibited the growth of HT29 cancer cells through the induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by the down regulation of the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL gene products. Furthermore, the results of the in vitro hemolysis assay with human erythrocytes demonstrated the excellent blood biocompatibility of TS-CSNPs. Our silica coated TS-CSNPs exhibited a non-significant effect on the viability of both Gram negative and Gram positive bacterial strains up to 18 hours of exposure. These results highlight that modified TS-CSNPs can be functionalized to enhance the efficacy of cancer therapeutics due to the significant potential against cancerous cells and antibacterial activity.</field>

		<field name="AB">Pectin oligosaccharides (POSs) are being recognized as potent prebiotics, given their structural complexity. Here, POSs were generated from apple pectin, rhamnogalacturonan-I and homogalacturonan with different degrees of esterification (high and low) using an optimized concentration of trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting POSs were analytically characterized, revealing that they contain linear and branched oligomers with a degree of polymerization (DP) up to 7. Biological activity of the generated POSs was determined in terms of immuno- and bacterio-modulatory perspectives. POSs significantly reduced the inflammatory response triggered by lipopolysaccharide and promoted the growth of several bacteria beneficial to the human gut. Overall results indicate that the degree of esterification of POSs is not a key element, but length of the DP and structure of POSs are responsible for biological outcomes. Owing to their biological activity, the POSs generated here can be considered as effective prebiotics and can be exploited for maintaining immune and microbial homeostasis in the human gut.</field>

Native glucomannans have been consumed for centuries in Asia within food products and are permitted food thickeners through the world. However, their strong gel structures limit applications in the diet. Depolymerised and native glucomannans are considered therefore in this review with relevant dietary applications.

		<field name="AB">Environmental contamination with TiO2 and the use of TiO2 as a food additive (E171) or in cosmetics result in human exposure to TiO2 via inhalation, ingestion, and through skin contact. When inhaled, most TiO2 particles are cleared via the mucociliary escalator and are then swallowed. Together with the ingestion of E171, this process results in a significant exposure of the human gastro-intestinal tract to TiO2. One of the functions of the intestine is to protect the body from external aggression, via the so-called intestinal barrier function. The aim of this study was to determine whether, and through which mechanisms, TiO2 affects this function. Caco-2 and HT29-MTX cells were co-cultured to reconstitute an in vitro mucus-secreting intestinal epithelium. This epithelium was exposed to TiO2-NPs, either pure anatase or mixed anatase/rutile, or to E171. Two exposure scenarii were used: acute exposure for 6 h or 48 h after cell differentiation (21 days post-seeding), or repeated exposure during the course of cell differentiation, i.e., twice a week for 21 days post-seeding. Epithelial cells repeatedly exposed to TiO2 developed an inflammatory profile, together with increased mucus secretion. Epithelial integrity was unaltered, but the content of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family xenobiotic efflux pumps was modified. Taken together, these data show that TiO2 moderately but significantly dysregulates several features that contribute to the protective function of the intestine.</field>

		<field name="AB">Carbohydrate malassimilations (CM) belong to clinically important adverse food reactions. They are characterized as non-immunological and dose-dependent reactions to carbohydrates. These food intolerances affect 20 - 30% of the German population. Typical CM include lactose-, fructose- and sorbitol-malabsorption. The causes of these conditions are deficient digestion (lactose malabsorption) or insufficient absorption of the carbohydrate form the small intestine (fructose-and/or sorbitol-malabsorption). The affected patients experience nonspecific symptoms including diarrhea, bloating, nausea, and abdominal cramps. The diagnostic evaluation is based on a nutritional history, an H-2 breath test, ultrasonography, endoscopy and stool culture. The therapy of these pathologic conditions includes extensive dietary restriction of the relevant sugar. The elimination of the responsible carbohydrate normally leads to a significant improvement of the patient's complaints. CM can be easily confused with irritable bowel syndrome. Currently it is still unclear, if carbohydrate malassimilation contributes to the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome. There is increasing evidence that gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by CM may be an important triggering factor of irritable bowel syndrome.</field>

		<field name="AB">Genetically modified microorganisms (GMM), harbouring commonly antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes as selection markers, are frequently used to produce food and feed enzymes, additives and flavourings. Such commercialized microbial fermentation products should not contain GMM, or associated recombinant DNA. Although the use of AMR genes gives rise to public health and environmental concerns regarding their potential acquisitions by pathogens and gut microbiota, no method targeting AMR genes harboured by such GMM is currently available for the enforcement laboratories. In reason of the increasing interest of the competent authorities to be able to assess the potential risks related to the presence of these AMR genes in microbial fermentation products, we propose therefore for the first time a PCR-based strategy easily implementable in enforcement laboratories. This strategy targets a chloramphenicol resistance gene, highlighted by the patent analysis performed in this study as being harboured by a noteworthy part of GMM producing microbial fermentation products from the food and feed industry. First, the potential presence of the AMR gene is detected by real-time PCR. Next, its full-length is evaluated by a nested-PCR amplifying a large fragment of its sequence to determine the risks of likely AMR gene acquisition. This strategy allows thus to support the competent authorities regarding the measures to be taken in case of unexpected DNA contaminations from such GMM in commercialized microbial fermentation products.</field>

The Scopus system was used to analyze the relevant scientific publications for the last 15 years (with an emphasis on the last three years). An HPLC method was used to determine the flavonoids spectrum and content. The formulation of the terms bioaccessibility, bioavailability and bioeffectiveness was clarified. The factors affecting flavonoids assimilation, following their route from the raw food material through the ready-to-eat product and the dietary intake, passing through the gastrointestinal tract and microbiota effect were followed. The presented data concerned total content of catechin, quercetin and total content of flavanones with confirmed relatively better bioavailability. The food spectrum covered fruits, vegetables, chocolate and wines. The presented data associated with flavonoid content in foods, available in Bulgarian diet, completed with information on their bioaccessibility and bioavailability can be successfully used for establishment of preventive and healthy nutrition.</field>

		<field name="AB">The EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of agar (E 406) as a food additive. In the European Union (EU), agar (E 406) has been evaluated by the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) in 1989, who allocated to agar a not specified acceptable daily intake (ADI), and by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) in 1974, who considered very few data to conclude to a not limited ADI. According to the conceptual framework for the risk assessment of certain food additives re-evaluated under Commission Regulation (EU) No 257/2010, the Panel considered that the safety assessment is limited to the use and use levels received from industry in 7 food categories for which data were considered in this opinion out of the 70 food categories in which agar (E 406) is authorised; an indicative high refined exposure assessment up to 26 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day has been calculated in toddlers at the 95th percentile (non-brand-loyal scenario); agar is unlikely to be absorbed unchanged and slightly fermented by intestinal microbiota; sufficient toxicity data were available; there was no concern with respect to the genotoxicity of agar; no carcinogenic effects were reported in carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats at the doses of 4,500 mg/kg bw per day and 2,500 mg/kg bw per day, respectively, the highest doses tested; oral intake of agar (4,500 mg/person corresponding to 64 mg/kg bw per day) was tolerated in humans for 12 weeks without noticeable side effects. Therefore, the Panel concluded that there is no need for a numerical ADI for agar and that there is no safety concern for the general population at the refined exposure assessment for the reported uses of agar as a food additive.

		<field name="AB">The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effect of the direct addition of the freeze-dried probiotic culture (Lactobacillus casei, 2 g/L) and prebiotics (oligofructose or polydextrose, 20 g/L) on the physicochemical characteristics, probiotic survival and on the acceptance of pasteurised sugarcane juice during refrigerated storage (7 degrees C / 28 days). The incorporation of oligofructose or polydextrose resulted in products with physicochemical characteristics, texture, acceptance and storage stability similar to the pure product. L. casei remained viable in the product (&gt; 10(9) CFU/mL), but its addition increased the acidity, turbidity, luminosity and green colour of the products, and decreased the acceptance during the storage period. The present work demonstrated that it is possible to directly add the freeze-dried probiotic culture (L. casei) to the sugarcane juice, replacing the traditional methods of activation and propagation of the culture in Man Rogosa Sharp broth or juice, resulting in an easier and faster manufacturing process and high probiotic counts (&gt; 10(9) CFU/mL). However, the probiotic inoculum should be further optimised in order to minimise the physicochemical and sensory alterations. (C) All Rights Reserved</field>

		<field name="AB">Commercial nanopowders of MgB2 were characterized from the viewpoint of granulometric distribution, structure, microstructure, and pH behavior in water. The powders are very different: a higher amount of the MgB2 phase with a lower tendency for agglomeration determines a higher rate of pH-increase. A higher rate of pH-increase usually produces a stronger antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Candida parapsilosis reference strains. The variation of the pH-increase rate suggests the possibility of temporo-spatial control of MgB2 bioactivity, although the contribution of other factors should not be neglected. Remarkably, the efficiency of the MgB2 powders is higher against biofilms than on microbes in the planktonic state. Further, our experiments confirm the antimicrobial efficiency of MgB2 in the in vitro tests against 29 methicillin resistant clinical S. aureus isolates and 33 vancomycin resistant E. faecium/faecalis strains, but in this case the biofilms are more resistant than planktonic cells. The MgB2 treatment of infected mice led to a significant decrease of E. coli colonization in liver, spleen and peritoneal liquid and it also caused changes in the intestinal microbiota. The activity of powders on HeLa and HT-29 tumor cell lines was assessed by inverted microscopy, flow cytometry, and evaluation of the cellular cycle. MgB2 inhibits tumor cell growth influencing DNA synthesis (S-phase). The obtained results indicate that the tested powders could provide promising solutions for the development of large-spectrum multifunctional antimicrobial and anti-biofilm agents, and/or for anti-cancer therapies.

		<field name="AB">The food additive curcumin shows many benefits for human health but has low solubility and stability, which leads to its low bioavailability. After oral administration, curcumin undergoes biotransformation by gut microbiota in digestive tracts, and thus it is interesting to characterize the biotransformation products of curcumin and assess their bioactivities to help us understand the pharmacology. Herein a bacterial strain of Bacillus megaterium DCMB-002 isolated from mice feces, showed the capability of transforming curcumin to its various derivatives. The tracing high performance liquid chromatogram coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectra (HPLC-Q-TOF MSn) led to the identification of seven hydrogenation transformation metabolites through reduction, hydroxylation, demethylation and demethoxylation etc, six of which were reported for the first time. The metabolites exhibited moderate antioxidant activity. The findings provided insights into the microbial biotransformation of curcumin and roles of gut microbiota in its pharmacological effects.</field>

		<field name="AB">Tannins are the most abundant among the plant-derived antinutrients that bind readily with protein and other macromolecules to form indigestible complexes, thereby reducing the nutritional value of the plant feedstuffs. Presence of tannase-producing gut microbiota in herbivorous animals has been suggested to overcome the antinutritional effects of tannins. However, this topic has been less investigated in herbivorous/omnivorous fish species. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the presence of tannase-producing autochthonous microbiota in the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of some culturable freshwater teleosts and to identify most promising tannase-producing strains by molecular methods. Isolation and enumeration of tannase-producing autochthonous microbiota have been carried out in the gut of ten culturable freshwater teleosts, namely catla (Catla catla), silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), rohu (Labeo rohita), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), mrigal (Cirrhinus mrigala), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), bata (Labeo bata), kalbasu (Labeo calbasu), tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Culturable heterotrophic and tannase-producing microbial populations evaluated on tryptone soya agar and selective tannic acid agar media, respectively, revealed the maximum in the hindguts of all fish species studied. Out of 72 tannase-producing colonies, 18 randomly selected isolates were maintained as pure cultures and evaluated quantitatively for tannase production. Among these, four most promising tannase producers were identified by 16S/26S rDNA sequencing following nucleotide blast and deposited in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank. The strain LR01 isolated from rohu was a bacterium, Enterobacter asburae (GenBank Accession No. GU939631). However, the strains CM02, OM01 and LR03 isolated from mrigal, tilapia and rohu were yeasts and identified as Pichia kudriavzevii (GenBank Accession No. GU939629), Candida tropicalis (GenBank Accession No. GU911469) and Candida parapsilosis (GenBank Accession No. GU939630), respectively. To the authors' knowledge, the present study is the first to report tannase-producing autochthonous microbiota in the gut of freshwater teleosts. Tannin-degrading microbiota detected in the present study may endow the fish with some ecological advantages by enabling them to overcome the anti-nutritional effects of plant tannins.</field>

		<field name="AB">Vegetable lecithins, widely used in the food industry as emulsifying agents, are a mixture of naturally occurring lipids containing more than 50% of phospholipids of vegetable origin. Given the exponential demand for plant products alternative to those of animal origin and for clean-label foods (free of synthetic additives), the market of vegetable lecithin is booming. According to a number of in vitro and preclinical studies, the supplementation with vegetable lecithin may enhance intestinal lipid absorption. In humans, their use as supplements is associated with liporegulating and anti-inflammatory effects in pathological conditions. As such, in the current context of obesity and associated metabolic disorders, the potential application of vegetable lecithins in the prevention of such diseases seems promising. However, their impact as ingredients within the current Western diet on lipid metabolism and gut health remains poorly described in the literature and rather controversial. Researchers are currently starting to explore these effects. Their recent findings yield encouraging results concerning the impact of nutritional doses of lecithin similar to those found in foods on lipid metabolism and the gut microbiota.

To investigate the effect of RA on the changes of microbial diversity in animal intestinal tract, the viable cell count and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method were used to monitor the microbial number and species in vivo, and before that, we also evaluated its influence on the growth of some selected bacteria in vitro. Our results indicated that the RA had little or no effect on the growth of E. colt O157 H7, S. typhimurium, L. monocytogenes and B. longum, while could promote the growth of L. plantarum and inhibit that of S. aureus in vitro; moreover, the viable cell count and DGGE results confirmed that the RA posed little pressure on the composition of total bacteria, enterobacteria and lactobacilli in vivo. In conclusion, RA posed little pressure on the growth and the composition of microbes, suggesting it is safe for gut microbes.</field>

		<field name="AB">Bacterial resistance is a sanitary issue explained by indiscriminate use of nonprescription drugs, and antimicrobial use in food production for growth promotion. Bothropstoxin-I (BthTx-I) is a phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) from Bothrops jararacussu venom, which has a known antimicrobial effect. The goal of this study was the unprecedented evaluation of in vivo antimicrobial activity of BthTx-I in broilers. Microbiological, biochemical, and histological parameters were determined using 84 21-day old broilers that were kept in cages with four birds each at a density of 625 cm(2)/b roiler. The experiment was randomized by three treatments with seven repetitions of four broilers each that lasted seven days. The treatments were: 1) bacitracin zinc diet; 2) PLA(2)-BthTx-I; 3) without additives. The data obtained from the studied variables was subjected to analysis of variance and an F-test at the 5% significance level. Averages of each variable in each treatment were compared by Tukey's test. Broiler bacterial cloacal counts showed that BthTx-I decreased the microbial population without reducing body weight, intestinal morphology, or liver or kidney histopathological damage. The toxin showed in vivo activity, being an alternative for better performance in the production of broiler chickens, because it acted by decreasing the microbial load of potentially pathogenic bacteria in the intestinal microbiota of the birds and did not cause muscle, liver or kidney damage at the assessed dosage.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background: Cellulose nanocrystalline (CNC) particles possess unique functional properties such as vastly modifiable surface, considerable mechanical strength and acid resistance, as well as, high aspect ratio. CNCs have received great attention for application in diverse fields of technology including (composite) hydrogels fabrication for the gastric protection and enteral delivery of drugs and nutraceuticals. Scope and approach: The orogastrointestinal digestibility and absorbability of the orally administered CNCs is overviewed in the current article. At first, some surface charge-related characteristics of acid-isolated CNCs are communicated. Then, the biocompatibility and biodegradability of CNCs and CNC-reinforced hydrogels are reviewed, followed by presenting credible digestion and absorption scenarios. Finally, the post-absorption metabolism of CNCs is briefly debated. Key findings and conclusions: Bacterial cellulose shows good biocompatibility and hemocompatibility. CNC oxidation provides biologically beneficial impacts; for instance, the TEMPO- and periodate-oxidized CNCs have been shown to regulate some blood metabolic variables and improve the degradability in simulated human blood plasma, respectively. Spherical and carboxyl-bearing cellulose nanoparticles can be isolated through ammonium persulfate digestion. The sphericity of particles results in faster cellular uptake. Negatively-charged CNCs are non-mucoadhesive and thus upon ingestion can penetrate into the buccal and intestinal mucosa. One may augment the absorption of CNCs by targeted receptor-mediated endocytosis. It was postulated that sodium bicarbonate secretion into the duodenum can alter CNCs surface chemistry and influence CNC interaction with gut microbiota.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background: Food safety and food security remain the major concern of consumers and the food industry. Bacterial contamination continues to be a crucial food safety issue. Smart packaging incorporates both active and intelligent components. Intrinsic antibacterial activity, oxygen and ethylene scavenging (active) and the sensing (intelligent) properties of metal oxide nanoparticles are in research focus for application in smart food packaging, especially bio-nanocomposite films. Scope and approach: Metal oxide nanoparticle properties are closely linked to their morphology resulting from the synthesis process. In this review, we cover current innovative synthesis methods for obtaining metal oxide nanoparticles and current incorporation techniques used to obtain smart (active and/or intelligent) packaging, focusing on bio-nanocomposites, commonly used metal oxides and future mixed metal or doped metal oxides. Taking into account safety, we focus on current legislation, and methods for risk assessment due to particle release from the packaging material and a summary of cytotoxic studies of metal oxide nanoparticles on human cells and the gut microbiota. Key findings and conclusions: Antimicrobial effectiveness of metal oxide nanoparticles is highly dependent on morphology as a result of the synthesis method. Solution casting and electrospinning are innovative methods applied to synthesize metal oxide incorporated biopolymer films for active packaging with improved mechanical and barrier properties combined with active components (antimicrobial, ethylene scavenging). Metal oxides show sensitivity and selectivity to most gases produced during food spoilage. In selection of metal oxide for smart packaging, particle migration and cytotoxic activity are key issues requiring careful and detailed characterization.</field>

		<field name="AB">Recently, the effect of intestinal microbiota on the lungs has been reported in several studies as the gut-lung axis, which interferes with inflammatory processes through the translocation of bacterial products across the gastrointestinal tract barrier into blood vessels. In numerous studies, the anti-inflammatory properties of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii strains have been reported both in vivo and in vitro. In this process, the secretion of bioactive molecules with anti-inflammatory effects is one of the strategies that the bacterium uses. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have drawn the attention of scientists due to their role in cell-to-cell communication either locally or over long distances. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii supernatant and EVs on the expression profile of cytokines and chemokines by using lung cancer cell line (A549). Principal analysis showed that the bacterial supernatant and derived EVs were able to dysregulate the expression of some specific cytokines. However, the response of bacterium-secreted EVs was more significant compared to the bacterial supernatant for some key cytokines. The secreted EVs significantly could upregulate anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-2 and IL-1Ra). On the other hand, F. prausnitzii EVs could downregulate some of the important pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF- and TNF-.</field>

		<field name="AB">Nanotechnology offers significant potential benefits to many fields, including food and agricultural industries, which have opportunities to provide products to the general public that could result in ingested nanoparticles (NPs). Herein, we explored the possible impacts of orally administered TiO(2)NPs, SiO(2)NPs and AgNPs on gut microbiota composition and colitis induction in mice. We administered the NPs to mice at doses of 2.5 mg/kg bw/day for 7 days, which was a dose relevant to human dietary intake for TiO(2)NPs and SiO(2)NPs or the acute oral exposure following medical oral application of AgNPs. No overall toxicity was recorded in mice exposed to TiO(2)NPs and SiO(2)NPs except increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) in the colons of mice that ingested SiO(2)NPs. The colitis-like symptoms induced in the mice that ingested AgNPs included high disease activity index and histological scores, disruption of microvilli and tight junctions in the intestinal epithelium, and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Gene analysis by 16S rRNA sequencing showed that AgNP ingestion induced shifts in the intra- and inter-phyla abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, increased the lowly abundant families of bacteria, and decreased the probiotic bacteria genus Lactobacillus. These results are similar to those reported in studies of other intestinal inflammatory disorders. SiO2NP ingestion in mice increased microbial species richness and diversity within the intestinal tract, and in particular, an obvious increase of the genus Lactobacillus was recorded. No obvious disturbance of gut microbiota was found in mice that ingested TiO(2)NPs. The study suggests that alterations in microbiota composition are associated with oral responses to nanoparticle exposure.</field>

		<field name="AB">Optimising the production of insects for food and feed and ensuring their health are growing concerns for producers. Insects suffer from a range of insect pathogenic microorganisms, and the management of such diseases is essential. One solution is the introduction of beneficial probiotic bacteria into the diet of the insects. Here, we show that a lactic acid bacterial strain, Pediococcus pentosaceus, isolated from the gut of the mealworm, Tenebrio molitor, was able to inhibit the growth of selected insect pathogens in vitro. Using in vivo assessments of the host's fitness benefits conferred by the lactic bacterium we show a significant effect of P. pentosaceus on larval growth rate and survival into adulthood. Gut microbiota analysis focusing on bacterial composition based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing suggests that P. pentosaceus could have successfully colonised the guts, or altered their bacteria, of the larvae that received it. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of mass insect production systems and outline the remaining work needed to explore and secure the role of beneficial bacterial additives in the field.</field>

		<field name="AB">Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are frequently orally consumed as dietary supplements with various commercially available products (e.g., Nano-silver and Mesosilver) claimed to yield health benefits across an array of areas. While the mechanism by which AgNPs might provide health benefits is unclear, these benefits could potentially be related to either the release of dissolved monovalent Ag species (such as Ag+) or the ability of AgNPs to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent influence on the gut microbiome or eukaryotic cells. In this study, we investigate the in vitro Ag(i) and ROS (particularly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals (OH)) generation by Mesosilver over a range of pHs (2-7) typical of the human gut and upper digestive system. Our results show that Mesosilver undergoes rapid oxygen-mediated oxidative dissolution and associated H2O2 production with the generation rate of both Ag(i) and H2O2 increasing with decrease in pH and increase in NaCl concentration. No impact of increase in temperature from 22 degrees C to 37 degrees C was observed on the oxidative dissolution of Mesosilver. Addition of H2O2 further accelerates the dissolution of Mesosilver and causes production of OH under all pH conditions investigated here. The presence of pepsin, an enzyme present in gastric fluid, resulted in a slight decrease in the extent of release of Ag(i) and H2O2 generation under acidic conditions. A kinetic model is developed based on our experimental results enabling prediction of the dissolved Ag(i) and ROS yield on dissolution of these nanoparticles under conditions typical of the human digestive system.</field>

		<field name="AB">Reducing compounds from plants are abundant in our diet, especially phenolic compounds (polyphenols). They are too often termed antioxidants whereas this notion remains fuzzy and open to abuse. Polyphenols and other reducing micronutrients can actually participate in the protection of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) against oxidation, not only in foods (including as additives) but also in the digestive tract. This aptitude can be summarily evaluated by the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) but must be confirmed in more elaborate tests involving PUFAs. By contrast, crediting them with an antioxidant activity in tissues (beyond the digestive tract) on the sole basis of a high TAC value is abusive, on the one hand because fighting chronic oxidative stress via a plant-rich diet involves a great variety of mechanisms and remains tightly associated with anti-inflammatory actions, on the other hand because polyphenols generally undergo extensive catabolism by the intestinal microbiota and are distributed to tissues under the form of metabolites whose structures are very different from those of the dietary forms.

		<field name="AB">High levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA)-coated bacteria may have a role in driving inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We therefore investigated the effect of sodium butyrate on microbiota in IBD prone interleukin (IL)-10(-/-) mice. At 8 weeks of age, mice were allocated into three groups (n = 4/group): normal (C57BL/6), IL-10(-/-), and IL-10(-/-) treated with sodium butyrate (100 mM). Severity of colitis, inflammatory cytokine and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration in proximal colon contents, the percentage of IgA-coated bacteria and microbiota composition by 16S ribosomal RNA assessment of stool were measured after 4 weeks of treatment. Sodium butyrate ameliorated histological colitis and decreased levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-6 in IL-10(-/-) mice compared with those without treatment. At the phylum level, a reduction in Bacteroidetes and an increase in Firmicutes in IL-10(-/-) mice treated with sodium butyrate were observed. Additionally, Prevotellaceae species were reduced in IL-10(-/-) mice treated with sodium butyrate as compared with those without treatment. The level of biodiversity was slightly increased and the amount of IgA-coated bacteria decreased in IL-10(-/-) mice treated with sodium butyrate compared with those without treatment. Our results indicate that sodium butyrate protects against colitis, possibly through modifying the gut microbiota, enriching biodiversity and reducing the amount of colitogenic IgA-coated bacteria in IL-10(-/-) mice.</field>

		<field name="AB">Plant food additives are becoming more and more popular and broadly applied products, though the information on risks they poses to the organism is limited and contradictive. Obesity and overeating are some of the commonest health issues around the world, and people are increasingly consuming workability-enhancing preparations as a simple and fast method of weight control. The plant-based preparations are considered less harmful than the synthetic chemical ones. Lavandula angustifolia Mill., Melissa officinalis L. and Vitex angus-castus L. are broadly used as food additives and medicinal plants, despite the fact that their complex physiological assessment on model animals in the conditions of obesity has not yet been performed. We carried out a 30-day experiment on white male rats. All the animals were given high-fat diet, and the experimental animals, in addition to this diet, received 5% crumbled dry herbs of L. angustifolia, M. officinalis or V. angus-castus. Taking into account the overall amount of consumed food, the mean daily gain in body weight; at the end of the experiment, we determined the index of the weight of the internal organs, biochemical and morphological blood parameters. At the beginning and the end of the experiment, the rats were examined for motor and orienting activities, and emotional status. Rats on high-fat diet gained up to 112% body weight by the end of the experiment, while rats that had received V. angus-castus gained up to 119%, M. officinalis - 135%, L. angustifolia - 139%, compared with the initial body weight. Addition of medicinal plants to the diet led to increase in average daily weight increment, significantly and reliably after consuming lavender and lemon balm, less significantly and unreliably after eating Vitex. L. angustifolia and M. officinalis reduced the relative brain weight, and ingestion of L. angustifolia and M. officinalis caused notable decrease in the relative mass of the thymus (down to 58% and 47% of the relative weight of thymus in animals of the control group respectively). Also, these plants decreased the motor and orienting activities of the rats by the end of the experiment. As for the biochemical parameters of blood, the activity of alkaline phosphatase significantly increased to 406% following consumption of Melissa, to 350% after consuming lavender, and to 406% after Vitex, compared to the control group. Furthermore, all the groups were observed to have increased AST and ALT activities. Intake of lavender led to increases in cholesterol (to 125%) and LDL cholesterol (to 228%), whereas the groups that consumed lemon balm were observed to have decreases in urea nitrogen (to 79%), totalbilirubin (to 63%) and triglycerides (to 63%). Addition of Vitex led to increase in the index of aterogenecity against the background of notable fall in HDL cholesterol (to 52% of the control group). The medicinal plants also contributed to the normalization of the glucose level. Morphological analysis of blood revealed no significant changes, except heightened content of monocytes in blood, which is characteristic of all groups, including the control. Effects of L. angustifolia, M. officinalis and V. angus-castus on the organism of rats on excessive-fat diet require additional histological, histochemical and immunological surveys.</field>

		<field name="AB">Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect an individual's ability to communicate and socialize, often associated with repetitive movements or behaviors. Frequently patients associate intellectual disability or digestive problems. Autism is more common in males and affects 1 in 88 children in USA. The mechanism that leads to ASD is very complex, involving genetic, epigenetic, immune and environmental factors that could act in different proportions, at different developmental stages (prenatal, perinatal or postnatal) and on different pathways. The general prototype consists in an initial systemic dysfunction, such as immune dysregulation, inflammation, impaired detoxification or oxidative stress in an individual with genetic predisposition. In this context, ASD may arise due to the harmful action of environmental factors that lead to neuroinflammation and abnormal brain development. Environmental factors involved in autism determinism could be very diverse and include classical extrinsic factors (toxicants, environmental pollutants, medications, food additives, electromagnetic fields and even social influences), maternal disorders or lifestyle factors, as well as intrinsic factors (hormones, inflammatory mediators, microbiota and other biological molecules that make up the microenvironment around the developing fetal or neonatal brain). The aim of the present review is to discuss actual theories concerning genetic, epigenetic, immunologic and environmental factors interplay in ASD determinism, to present a practical and global approach of this complex problem, as well as to point some of the new directions for ASD prevention and therapy.</field>

		<field name="AB">The aim of this research was to observe the combined usability of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus durans strains, which are resistant to adverse environmental conditions, together with commercial probiotic starters in the production of probiotic fermented milk. Accordingly, eight different probiotic fermented milks were produced; AF:Lactobacillus acidophilus + Enterococcus faecium, BF:Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis + Enterococcus faecium, CF:Lactobacillus casei + Enterococcus faecium, RF:Lactobacillus rhamnosus + Enterococcus faecium, AD:Lactobacillus acidophilus + Enterococcus durans, BD:Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis + Enterococcus durans, CD:Lactobacillus casei + Enterococcus durans, RD:Lactobacillus rhamnosus + Enterococcus durans. As a result of the data obtained in the study, it was found that fermented dairy products containing Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus durans had no negative effects on the physicochemical, rheological properties and probiotic viability, and positively affected the sensory properties of the samples. The viscosity and hardness values of probiotic fermented milk produced by combining with E. durans were higher than by combining with E. faecium and serum separation was not occurred. Also, probiotic bacteria viability was higher than 7 log cfu/ml level at the end of the storage period. Practical applications Enterococci are found naturally in the human intestinal microbiota and are highly resistant to adverse environmental conditions. Enterococcus strains that produce antimicrobial peptides such as enterocin were found to be able to effectively inhibit the development of many food pathogens when they are added to some foods including cheese. They are microbial additives that are thought to be used in many foods to improve food safety. The bacteriocin called enterocin could act as natural bio-preservatives in foods. This study will guide the use of Enterococcus species as bio-preservative in foods such as dairy products and the possibility of the continuation of probiotic viability.</field>

		<field name="AB">Exposure to silica nanoparticles (SNPs) causes lung fibrosis and threatens human health. However, it is unknown if low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure exacerbates SNP-induced lung dysfunction. Thus, the aim of our study was to determine the combined effect of SNPs and LDR on lung fibrosis and elucidate the potential mechanisms involved. We used SNP-induced A549 cells and mouse models and detected gut microbiota alteration by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Additionally, lung fibrosis-related parameters were also detected using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, immunofluorescence (IF) staining, qRT-PCR, and western blot analysis. The histopathological and IF staining assays illustrated that co-exposure of mice to SNPs and LDR had a significant deleterious effect on both lung function and lung fibrosis, in comparison to exposure to SNPs or LDR alone. Furthermore, the abundance of Bacteroidetes significantly increased while that of Firmicutes significantly decreased following co-exposure to SNPs and LDR. Mechanistically, the Notch cascade was activated in chronically SNP-exposed mice with lung fibrosis and A549 cells. Additionally, the Notch pathway-associated proteins showed increased expression levels in the lungs following SNP exposure both in vivo and in vitro. Notably, SNP-induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiota promoted lung epithelial damage by triggering the Notch pathway, resulting in SNP-induced lung fibrosis. However, oral administration of probiotics protected the mice from SNP-induced lung injury. Our results strongly indicate that the activation of the gut microbiota-dependent Notch pathway in response to co-exposure to SNPs and LDR results in lung epithelial injury in vivo. Probiotics supplementation is a potential way to protect against SNP- and LDR-induced lung fibrosis.</field>

		<field name="AB">Purpose In this study, alfalfa (Medicago sativa), chaya (Cnidoscolus chayamansa), broad bean (Vicia faba), and amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus) leaves were used to produce protein concentrates, which were evaluated to be used as food additives. Methods The digestibility and bioaccessibility of protein concentrates were studied using an Automatic and Robotic Intestinal System (ARIS). Furthermore, the effect of the protein concentrates on the composition of the gut microbiota of a population of children was evaluated. Results The differences in bioaccessibility of all protein concentrates was statistically significant (p = 0.01) when compared to a standard diet (&gt; 1 g/100 g), mainly in amaranth (AMA) at the stomach and small intestine sections (similar to 1.6 and 1.2 g/100 respectively). AMA samples showed the highest protein content (25.30 +/- 0.37 mg/g of protein) and digestible indispensable amino acid score (&gt; 90%) using the child amino acid scoring pattern (6 months-3 years). The predominant bacterial genera in children's gut microbiota were Lactobacillus (3.3 x 10(6)), Bifidobacteria (1.3 x 10(6)), Clostridium (1.8 x 10(6)), and Enterobacteria (5.9 x 10(5)). However, following three digestion cycles after supplementation with the AMA protein concentrate in ARIS, a significant increase (p &gt; 0.01) in the titer of beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus: 3.6 x 10(7) and Bifidobacteria: 1.5 x 10(7)) could be observed, when compared to initial values. Amino acid bioaccessibility (similar to 1.18-2.0 g/100 mL) was also significantly higher, across all sections (p &gt; 0.01) during continuous digestion, when compared to initial values (0.07-1.35 g/100 mL). Conclusion The AMA protein concentrates proved to be of good quality (% DIAAS &gt; 99) and a bioaccessible protein source, with good potential as a substrate for stimulating the growth of beneficial bacteria in the colon. This could lead to the production of biomolecules that would promote health in the target population (children). Graphic Abstract</field>

		<field name="AB">Dietary fiber and slow carbohydrates can have differential beneficial effects on gut microbial composition and metabolism. Insoluble substrates such as RS cannot be used in continuous simulation systems and we tested an in vitro batch fermentation system for possible prebiotic effects using waxy maize starch granules, pectin-rich potato fiber, and potato lintner starch tested with human fresh fecal microbiota spiked with the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM. Microbial quantification by real-time polymerase chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that Bacteroidetes was specifically suppressed by each insoluble carbohydrate resulting in a clear decrease in the ratio of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Notably, all carbohydrates tested appeared to block the formation of the potentially harmful branched chain fatty acids (BCFA) fermentation products, but supported lactobacilli growth and increase in lactic acid production. Potato lintner starch had the greatest effect. Insoluble carbohydrates also suppressed production of SCFAs as compared to the control medium. Importantly, potato lintner starch most efficiently suppressed the ratio between the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes and suppressed growth of bifidobacteria, Enterobactericeae and Faecalibacterium prausnizii. Degradative resistance of the lintner starch were linked to these effects. Problems using continuous fermentation systems for insoluble prebiotics and interpretation of batch fermentation data are discussed.</field>

		<field name="AB">The rapid growth in microbiome research, particularly during the last 15 years, has revealed the crucial contributions of microbial communities to numerous physiological functions in animals, including digestion, immunity and reproduction. The permanent coexistence of these various bionts forms the holobiont (namely, the host and its microbiota). This review describes the relationships between xylophagous insects and their microbiota in an attempt to understand the characteristics that have determined bacterial fidelity over generations and throughout evolutionary history. Symbiotic interactions have probably played a central role in the evolutionary success of these insects, allowing their adaptation to unexploited ecological niches that are nutritionally deficient and/or unbalanced. Moreover, insect symbionts have provided the enzymatic capabilities that enable the synthesis of nutrients (carbon and nitrogen sources for the host) from recalcitrant plant polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin or lignin).</field>

		<field name="AB">The health effects of lipids must now be explored beyond their energy content and fatty acid profile. Indeed, fatty acids as unit elements of different molecules such as triacylglycerols and phospholipids, being organized in various supramolecular structures such as emulsion droplets, and incorporated in complex food matrixes. This short article reviews our recent studies on the impact of fat emulsified structure on postprandial lipid metabolism and fatty acid beta-oxidation in normal- weight and obese humans, leading to the concept of ``fast vs slow lipids''. We also show how the postprandial kinetics of lipid absorption can contribute to modulate metabolic endotoxemia, partly arising from interactions between dietary lipids and gut microbiota, and able to contribute to metabolic inflammation in obesity. Finally, we highlight the pro- or anti-inflammatory impact in mice of surface active agents used in food formulation to stabilize emulsions, notably phospholipids of vegetal or dairy origin, and different molecular carriers of long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The interested reader will refer to our other recent publications and reviews on these topics for a deeper insight into presented concepts.

		<field name="AB">In this study, 18 barrows (Duroc X Landrance X Yorkshire) with average initial body weight of 30.72 (+/- 1.48) kg fitted with a T-cannula in the terminal ileum were randomly allotted to 3 treatments to determine the underlying mechanisms of the regulation role of SCFAs on the intestinal development in a pig model. The treatment groups were: (1) control, (2) antibiotics, Ab, (3) antibiotics + SCFAs (acetic, propionic and butyric acids; 61.84, 18.62, and 12.55 mM, respectively), AS. Antibiotics administration decreased total viable bacteria in the porcine feces by 10 folds (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with the control group, pigs in the Ab group had lower SCFAs concentrations in the serum and digesta, as well as decreased SCFAs receptors abundances in the ileum and colon (P &lt; 0.05). However, the SCFAs concentrations and SCFAs receptors abundances in the AS group were higher than those of Ab group (P &lt; 0.05). SCFAs infusion led to alteration of the intestinal index, morphology and elevation of the intestinal development-related genes abundances and the nutrients digestibility and decreasing of the percentage of apoptotic cells when compared with the Ab group (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, SCFAs infusion enhanced TJP1 and MUC-1 abundances and decreased the IL8 abundance in ileum and colon, which were accompanied by greater numbers of Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp., and less counts of Escherichia coli in these intestinal segments (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, this study provides the systematic and potent evidences demonstrated that distal ileal infusion of SCFAs could stimulate intestinal growth and improve gut barrier function in a pig model.</field>

		<field name="AB">Experimental ulcerative colitis was developed in 3-month old male mice fed with sodium dextran sulphate in drinking water for 7 days. Sodium dextran sulphate-induced ulcerative colitis was characterized by acute moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis accompanied by symptoms of the anxiety disorders and depression, changes in microbiota and morphology of colon and brain, activation of lipid peroxidation processes in the colon, blood and brain regions responsible for cognitive function, emotion and mood. Two-week daily administration to ulcerative colitis-mice the mixture of the selected strains of probiotics with antipsychotic and antifungal activities in free form and immobilized on the micronized composition of chemically modified natural minerals (80% zeolite, 10% diatomite, and 10% bentonite) decreased ulcerative colitis disease activity index score, improving some of the symptoms associated with disease, effectively restored gut microbiota balance, prevented signs of microbial translocation, alleviated symptoms associated with depression/anxiety and histopathological changes in colon and brain, and protected against oxidative stress via inhibition of lipid peroxidation in the colon, blood and regions of corticolimbic system. Nevertheless, further study is needed to confirm whether free and/or immobilized probiotics are effective in managing ulcerative colitis patients in combination with conventional drugs to avoid or delay step-up therapies with drugs burdened by potentially serious side effects.</field>

		<field name="AB">Solid phase extraction (SPE) methodology has been evaluated as a cleanup strategy prior to the analysis of phenolic metabolites in fecal samples by UPLC-DAD-ESI-TQ MS. Among the sorbents tested, Oasis (R) HLB led to the higher phenolic standard recoveries. Sample acidification (0.4 M HCl, final concentration) before SPE considerably improved standard recoveries. Values of the process efficiency (C-SPE/C-Without (SPE)) for a standard solution containing gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, benzoic acid, 3-phenylpropionic acid, (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin, procyanidin B2, and 4-hydroxybenzoic 2,3,5,6 d(4) acid were acceptable (&gt;90 %) for all compounds, except for procyanidin B2 (26 %). The developed SPE methodology was applied to fecal samples of individuals subjected to a wine intervention study. Phenolic metabolites, including intermediate metabolites (phenyl-gamma-valerolactones and phenylvaleric acid derivatives) and end products (simple phenols, hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxyphenylacetic, hydroxycinnamic, and hydroxybenzoic acids) were identified. Most of the compounds (n=14) exhibited values of process efficiency between 85 and 115 %. Although some compounds (n=4) showed process efficiency&gt;115 %, there was a group of metabolites (4-O-methylgallic acid, syringic acid, and 4-hydroxy-5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-valeric acid) whose process efficiency was &lt;85 %, which represented a serious limitation and made us to discard SPE as a preparative technique for the analysis of these phenolic metabolites. Finally, the paper reports the concentrations of phenolic metabolites in a randomized set of human fecal samples from healthy volunteers (n=15) without any previous SPE application. Large inter-individual variability was observed, which was attributed to differences in human gut microbiota composition.</field>

		<field name="AB">According to WHO, in 2016 around 13% of the world's adult population (11% of men and 15% of women) were obese. The global prevalence of obesity almost tripled between 1975 and 2016. In this context, it is important to note that the continuous increase in life expectancy, the desire for a better quality of life, and the high cost of medical care have led to a growing demand for functional foods in the market. People have started to realize that their food choices and their unhealthy lifestyles have consequences for their health. An important role in this scenario is associated with functional foods containing probiotic strains, reported to benefit human health. Here we report the development of natural yogurts based on native probiotic starter cultures of Enterococcus sp. strain BB3 (MK681869) and Lactobacillus sp. strain BB6 (MK681868), isolated from raw cow milk of La Araucania region of Chile. The odor and taste were the main parameters criticized by the consumer, the analysis of CG-MS elucidated that the yogurt produced by the strain Enterococcus sp. strain BB3 (MK681869) produced a higher amount of heptan-2-one, associated with a cheesy type odor, with less acceptance by the consumers. The acceptability of 6 types of yogurt was evaluated with a randomized analysis of 60 participants. The development of a functional dairy product based on probiotics is of interest because of its relation with positive changes in gut microbiota, and at the same time with a possible decrease in body weight.</field>

		<field name="AB">This study was aimed at analysing the dietary fibre (DF) content and prebiotic carbohydrate profile of two local pumpkin varieties (Villachchi, Moragollagama) and five imported hybrid varieties (Ariuna, Suprima, Abishek, Lara, Pmgathi) grown in Sri Lanka, and investigating the prebiotic potential of pumpkin powder in vivo using the pig as an animal model for human. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique was performed to identify the prebiotic carbohydrate profile. In the feeding trial, pigs were fed with standard diet (SD), pumpkin powder+ SD (PD), SD+ probiotics, and PD + probiotic. Freeze dried Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (500 mgday(-1)) and Lactobacillus acidophilus (500 mgday(-1)) were used as probiotic organisms. At the end of the experimental period, faecal microbial compositions of the pigs were analysed. Results revealed that the total DF content of pumpkin pulp did not vary (p &gt; 0.05) among varieties. However, the local varieties had higher (p &lt; 0.05) soluble DF (11.75 - 12.21 % dry matter) than the hybrid varieties. Mean concentrations of sorbitol, mannitol, stachyose + raffinose, verbascose + kestose and nystose of pumpkin were 106.7, 41.4, 76.5, 294.5 and 37.5 mg/100 g dry matter, respectively. Pumpkin powder fed pigs had higher (p &lt; 0.05) counts of faecal lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in comparison to SD fed pigs. In conclusion, this study revealed that pumpkin contains prebiotic carbohydrates, namely, sorbitol, mannitol, stachyose, raffinose, verbascose, kestose and nystose, and the feeding trial reflected prebiotic activity of pumpkin powder indicating a possibility to be used in functional foods.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a frequently diagnosed cancer that primarily affects the digestive system and an imperative cause of mortalities worldwide. Objective: In this work, we formulated the Tin oxide-Sodium alginate-Polyethylene glycol-Allyl isothiocyanate nanocomposites (SAP-Ally-NCs) and investigated its anticancer role against the DMH-provoked CRC in rats. Methodology: The formulated SAP-Ally-NCs were characterized different techniques. The CRC was provoked to the rats via injecting 20 mg/kg of DMH and then administered with the formulated SAP-Ally-NCs for 16 weeks. The bodyweight changes and the polyp's incidences were detected and tabulated. The status of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes were studied by standard techniques. The inflammatory markers and xenobiotic enzymes level was scrutinized using respective kits. The mRNA expressions of various signaling molecules were examined by RT-PCR. The liver and colon tissues were examined microscopically to detect the histological changes. Results: The formulated SAP-Ally-NCs treatment appreciably improved the body weight gain and suppressed the polyp's incidences in the DMH-challenged animals. SAP-Ally-NCs treated animals were demonstrated the notable reduction in the lipid peroxidation and inflammatory cytokines and elevated the antioxidant enzymes i.e. CAT and SOD activity. SAP-Ally-NCs administered animals exhibited the noticeable reduction in the expression of PCNA, cyclin-D1, iNOS, and COX-2 in the colon tissues. The histological findings also unveiled the therapeutic role of SAP-Ally-NCs. Conclusion: In conclusion, the SAP-Ally-NCs demonstrated the potent anticancer action against the DMH-provoked CRC in rats. In future, it could be a potent chemotherapeutic agent to the CRC.

		<field name="AB">Investigation of the combined addition of attapulgite clay and benzoic acid in fattening pig diets seems to be reasonable both from a pig performance and environmental point of view. In this research, an in situ experimental procedure was performed in order to investigate the effect of supplementing the conventional diet (CNVD) supplied to the fattening pigs of a commercial pig farm in Greece (based on maize, barley, wheat bran and soybean meal) with 0.4% w/w attapulgite and 0.5% w/w benzoic acid at the expense of maize (ATTBAD diet) on their feed efficiency and growth performance. The results suggested a significant increase (p &lt;= 0.05) in the total weight gain and the slaughter live-weight and a significant decrease (p &lt;= 0.05) in the feed intake and feed conversion ratio per fattening pig when supplied the ATTBAD. These results were further used as an input to a 'cradle-to-farm-gate' environmental Life Cycle Assessment. The functional unit (FU) was 1 kg of sold pig live-weight and the environmental impact categories (EICs) assessed were climate change (CC) and CC from direct land use change, acidification, eutrophication, land use, water use and fossil energy use. The indicators for all EICs were connected with lower potential estimates per FU in the ATTBAD system, suggesting an improvement of the environmental performance when the ATTBAD is supplied to the fattening pigs of the farm. The improvement of intestinal functionality and enzyme activity, an increase in digesta retention time and a drop of digesta pH in the gastrointestinal tract were indicated as possible causes for the improvement in the growth performance of the fattening pigs when supplied the ATTBAD diet, which however need to be confirmed with further research. The contribution analysis highlighted the importance of the decreased feed intake and the increased total weight gain of the fatteners on the improved environmental performance of the ATTBAD system. The reasonable differences between the indicator estimates of this study and relevant literature, the fair data quality which characterizes the compiled life cycle inventory and the results of the performed Monte Carlo simulation, are considered as a good indication of the validity of the received results and further support the argument of the ATTBAD system's improved environmental performance. Therefore, the use of the ATTBAD instead of the CNVD could potentially offer environmental benefits to the studied supply chain. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

		<field name="AB">Objective: The incidence of colorectal cancer has increased dramatically in recent years. One of the most important causes of colorectal cancer is infection with a specific type of Escherichia coli bacterium that has polyketide synthase (pks) gene, which produces a secreted toxin named colibactin that changes intestinal microflora condition for its pathogenicity and by interrupting the cell cycle triggers the development of colorectal cancer. Due to the drug resistance of this bacterium, it is necessary to produce new antimicrobial agents such as nanoparticles. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on the expression of clb genes of E. coli responsible for colorectal cancer. Methods: The synthesis of titanium dioxide nanoparticles was done by Bacillus tequilensis that was identified by sequencing 16S rRNA. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles were examined by ultraviolet spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy Real-Time PCR was used to analyze the effect of nanoparticles on clb expression. Human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK 293) cell line was treated with different concentrations of titanium dioxide nanoparticles for 72 hours and then cell viability and cytotoxicity were determined MTT method. Results: The synthesized nanoparticles were often spherical between 35.76-78.17 nm with absorption at 350 nm. RT PCR showed a 20-fold reduction in the expression of clbB and clbN genes. MTT showed that cell viability, increased after 72 hours that depends on titanium dioxide concentration. Conclusion: The results obtained in this study indicate that the synthesized nanoparticles could reduce the expression of clbB and clbN genes of E. coli with the lowest cytotoxicity. Therefore, it can be considered for the treatment of colon cancer caused by clb gene-positive E. coli.</field>

		<field name="AB">Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient sources added to Food (ANS) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the re-evaluation of karaya gum (E 416) as a food additive. Karaya gum (E 416) is an authorised food additive in the EU. Karaya gum (E 416) as specified in the Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is derived from the exudates from the stems and branches of strains of Sterculia urens Roxburgh and other species of Sterculia (family Sterculiaceae) or from Cochlospermum gossypium A. P. De Candolle or other species of Cochlospermum (family Bixaceae). An acceptable daily intake (ADI) 'not specified' was allocated by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), whereas the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) allocated an ADI of 12.5 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day. Karaya gum is practically undigested and not degraded by intestinal microflora and it is most probably not or only negligibly absorbed unchanged in humans. There is no concern with respect to the genotoxicity of karaya gum from Sterculia spp. Karaya gum (E 416) from Sterculia spp. did not induce toxic effects in animals at dose levels up to 1,250 mg/kg bw per day, the highest dose tested. Karaya gum from Sterculia spp. was well tolerated in humans at dose about 100 mg/kg bw per day for 4 weeks. The Panel concluded that there is no safety concern at the refined exposure assessment for the use of karaya gum as a food additive and that there is no need for a numerical ADI for karaya gum. The Panel further concluded that exposure to karaya gum by the use of this food additive should not exceed 7,000 mg/person per day in adults, the level at which some experienced abdominal discomfort.

		<field name="AB">Pomegranate fruit is recognized as an important source of health compounds and its juicy arils represent the most commercially exploitable part of the fruit. Nevertheless, by-products coming from pomegranate juice processing represent both a challenging disposal problem and a promising source of health ingredients. In particular, the marcs obtained after juice squeezing are usually discarded or used for oil production in virtue of their lipophilic fraction, although the residues of pericarp and arils are proven to still be a good source of hydrophilic compounds such as polyphenols. Pulsed ultrasound-assisted extraction, using just water as solvent, and spray-drying microdispersion, using low methoxyl pectin as polymeric matrix, have been employed, respectively, to extract and formulate the water-soluble bioactive molecules from these by-products. From 100 g of pomegranate fresh marcs, almost the same quantity of phenolic compounds found in 100 mL of the corresponding juice can be extracted with similar antioxidant activity, but with higher content in vitamin C and practically without total soluble solids. The extracts have been sprayed obtaining powders with an encapsulation efficiency of about 50%. The extracts, both before and after the microparticles production, have been characterized and their capacity in inhibition of platelets aggregation induced by thrombin has been tested ex vivo on human platelets (% inhibition: about 60% and 30% before and after microencapsulation, respectively). Finally, fresh-cut apple wedges were enriched by vacuum impregnation with the formulated extracts, tentatively used as potential novel ingredients, obtaining &quot;polyphenol-enriched&quot; apples.</field>

		<field name="AB">In vitro digestibility of stevioside, a natural sweetener, by various digestive enzymes was investigated. Stevioside was incubated with salivary alpha-amylase, pancreatic alpha-amylase, saliva, pepsin, gastric secretion, pancreatin and intestinal brush border membrane enzymes of mice, rats, and hamsters as well as with intestinal microflora of mice, rats, hamsters and humans. None of these enzymes digested stevioside except the microflora of the rat and hamster cecal contents, which hydrolyzed it to steviol, and the microflora of mouse cecal content and human feces, which hydrolyzed it to both steviol and steviol-16,17 alpha-epoxide. Steviol16,17 alpha-epoxide was then completely converted back into steviol. These results suggest that steviol might be the only metabolite produced by the intestinal microflora from various animal species and humans.</field>

		<field name="AB">The EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) provides a scientific opinion re-evaluating the safety of beta-cyclodextrin (E 459) as a food additive. beta-Cyclodextrin is a non-reducing cyclic oligosaccharide consisting of seven alpha-1,4-linked D-glucopyranosyl units. The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) allocated an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 5 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day to beta-cyclodextrin (E 459) in 1996. beta-Cyclodextrin is poorly absorbed following oral administration in animals and humans. It is hydrolysed to maltose and glucose by the gut microflora and endogenous amylases in the colon; consequently, beta-cyclodextrin levels in tissues and serum are low (&lt;1%). beta-Cyclodextrin has a low acute oral toxicity. Short-term and subchronic toxicity studies were available in rats and dogs. In rats, the main reported effect was an adaptive enlargement of the caecum, resulting from consumption of poorly digestible carbohydrates. From a 6-month study in rats, a no observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) of 600 mg/kg bw per day was identified and from a 52-week dogs study, the NOAEL was 466 and 476 mg/kg bw per day in males and females, respectively. The Panel considered that there was no indication for genotoxicity of beta-cyclodextrin. From a chronic toxicity studies in rats, a NOAEL of 654 and 864 mg/kg bw per day in males and females, respectively, was identified. Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were available and no evidence for carcinogenicity was found. The Panel concluded that, based on the available toxicological database, there is no reason to revise the current ADI of 5 mg/kg bw per day for beta-cyclodextrin. Based on the available reported use and use levels, the Panel also concluded that the ADI was exceeded in the refined brand-loyal scenario (considered the most relevant scenario) in all population groups except for infants at the mean and in all population groups at the 95th percentile.

		<field name="AB">This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of various levels of pectin and cellulose as non starch polysaccharides (NSPs) on performance and intestinal characteristics of broiler chickens. Four hundred day-old unsexed chickens were allocated to 4 experimental diets, 4 replications and 25 chickens in each with a completely randomized design (CRD). Experimental diets consisted of control diet (treatment 1) or diets containing different levels of pectin and cellulose - 2:1 (treatment 2), 1.5:1.5 (treatment 3) and 1:2 (treatment 4), respectively. On day 14, 21 and 42 of age two birds from each replicate were slaughtered and the intestinal microflora contents as well as viscosity were analyzed. Growth performance parameters considerably declined for 2:1 rate of pectin and cellulose (treatment 2) (P &lt; 0.05). Viscosity of distal intestine was significantly increased by 2:1 rate of pectin and cellulose at 14,21 and 42 days of age (P &lt; 0.05). In the same way, counts of Enterobacteriaceae in the ileum and caeca of broiler were also increased at 14 days of age (P &lt; 0.05). These effects led to lower performance. The number of lactic acid bacteria increased by treatment 3 (1.5:1.5 rate of pectin and cellulose) compared to other diets at 14 and 21 days of age (P &lt; 0.05). Lower viscosity was found by inclusion of 1.5:1.5 rate of pectin and cellulose (treatment 3) in the diet in all periods (P &lt; 0.05) and a relatively superior performance was achieved. Results of this study showed that interaction between various rates of pectin and cellulose could differently affect performance and physicochemical conditions of the intestine when present as compulsory ingredients in broiler chickens diets. This finding was approved by changed intestinal microflora, viscosity and performance.</field>

		<field name="AB">Constipation is a common cause of discomfort that affects the quality of life. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ameliorative effects of microencapsulated food products using Bacillus subtilis CBD2 strain-fermented grain in mice with loperamide-induced constipation. Microcapsules prepared by spray-drying with 2 % pectin and 2 % alginic acid (SD-P2A2) showed higher adhesion and dissolution of amylase than those prepared by freeze-drying. Experimental mice were fed a diet containing SD-P2A2 for 7 days prior to loperamide treatment. The ameliorative effects of an experimental diet containing SD-P2A2 on constipation were compared with those observed in mice fed a control diet containing non-fermented grain. Following the induction of constipation in mice, a marked alteration was observed in fecal parameters (frequency of defecation, fecal weights, fecal water content, and fecal pellet numbers in the distal colon), gastrointestinal transit ratios, harmful enzyme activities, and gene expression differences related to intestinal muscle contraction. These symptoms were significantly ameliorated in mice fed the experimental diet with SD-P2A2 versus constipated control mice. Thus, the intake of microencapsulated food products using B. subtilis CBD2 strain-fermented grain exhibited probiotic effects; these products may be used as a functional material for reducing constipation.</field>

		<field name="AB">In this study, we have attempted to determine the effects of dietary fructose polymers (fructan), high molecular-weight beta-(2,6)-linked levan, and low-molecular-weight beta-(2,1)linked inulin, on two intestinal enzymes (beta-glucuronidase and P-glucosidase). As a preliminary experiment, when intestinal microflora were cultured in anaerobic media harboring levan or its oligosaccharides, bacterial cell growth was observed in the levanoligosaccharide-supplemented media, but not in the levan-supplemented media, indicating that levan's size is important for the utilization by intestinal bacteria of levan as an energy source. In our animal study, the intake of a levan-rich diet was determined to significantly attenuate the activity of the harmful enzyme beta-glucuronidase, but did not affect the activity of P-glucosidase.</field>

		<field name="AB">The use of probiotics combined with prebiotics (synbiotics) has been proved to be more and more interesting in the market of functional foods. The use of probiotics alone has a long history whereas the concept of prebiotics is rather new, introduced by Gibson &amp; Roberfroid(1). Efficient prebiotics are considered the compounds that are not digested and selectively promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms (such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) in the colon. Some established prebiotics that are currently used in the European market are fructooligosaccharides (FOS), galactooligosaccharides (GOS) and inulin. However, there are more compounds considered as &quot;emerging prebiotics&quot; which have not been established yet, but there is a need of further investigation on them. Some of them are oligomers of soya &amp; xylan, isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMO), polydextrose and possibly some oligosaccharides in honey. There is still an incomplete picture of their fermentation properties but according to the studies performed till now, it is quite possible that these molecules might have the same or more desirable properties than the established ones. In this review, the effects of the established and emerging prebiotics on the gut microflora are presented, based on in vitro and in vivo studies (healthy volunteers).</field>

There was no difference in the qualitative and quantitative cecal microflora composition in rats fed cellulose and lignocellulose diets and those fed fiber-free diet. Guar gum and pectin diets significantly increased Bacteroidaceae compared to cellulase and lignocellulose diets. The counts of bifidobacteria were significantly higher in rats fed guar gum than in all the other groups. Clostridia were present in high counts in rats fed guar gum and pectin and generally absent in all the other groups. As regards 7 alpha-dehydroxylating cholic and chenodeoxycholic microorganisms, cellulose and lignocellulose diets significantly decreased these microbial counts compared to all the diets. The results show that dietary fiber can induce alterations of cecal microflora composition and intestinal bile acid metabolism.</field>

		<field name="AB">Background: Recent studies point at the anti-inflammatory action of silver through induction of apoptosis of inflammatory cells via oxidative stress, promotion of wound healing as well as antimicrobial effect. Our aim was to design a new formulation based on silver and validate its anti-inflammatory activity in the mouse models of colitis.Methods: Silver-coated glass beads were prepared using a magnetron sputtering method and a standard magnetron sputtering gun equipped with pure silver target. Colitis was induced by the ic administration of TNBS into colon (to mimic Crohn's disease) and addition of DSS to drinking water (to imitate ulcerative colitis). Evaluation of inflammation was performed based on macroscopic and microscopic scoring, quantification of the myeloperoxidase activity and colonic microflora analysis.Results: Silver-coated glass beads administered ic alleviated intestinal inflammation in mouse models of colitis, induced by TNBS and DSS. This alleviation of colitis resulted principally from changes in the gut microflora. The anti-inflammatory action of the new formulation was associated predominantly with the presence of the silver nanolayer on the beads, and to a lesser extent the size of glass polymer units.Conclusions: The application of the newly developed formulation employing silver-coated glass beads has the potential to be translated to clinical conditions for the efficient treatment of IBD.

		<field name="AB">The study was conducted to evaluate the effect of herbs as feed additive on performance of broiler alternative to antibiotics. One-day-old (N=320) broiler chicks were divided into eight treatment groups with four replicates of ten chicks. Six treatments were three herbs i.e. Allium sativum, Cassia angustifolia and Artemisia scoparia @0.5 and 1.0% respectively, control (basal diet), and a positive control (Oxyfeed (R) @2g/kg). In the study, the treatment groups, which were given diet supplemented with herb and antibiotic, exhibited improved weight gain, average daily gain, and feed conversion (P&lt;0.05). No significant difference was observed in feed intake (P&gt;0.05). The treatment groups supplemented with Allium sativum showed higher growth performance compared to Cassia angustifolia and Artemisia scoparia and control (P&lt;0.05). Relative organ weights and relative carcass yield of treatment groups were not significantly different (P&gt;0.05). The Relative length of the intestine of the treatment groups showed significant difference (P&lt;0.05). Supplementation of herbal additives and antibiotic had a positive effect on bacterial enumeration of Ileum (P&lt;0.05). The use of antibiotic caused a reduction in all three forms of microbial population. On the other hand, herbs added as feed additive acted as prebiotic and enhanced the lactic acid bacteria. In conclusion, supplementation of herbs as feed additive improved growth parameters and present results suggests herbs could be used as alternative to antibiotics growth promoting feed additives.</field>

		<field name="AB">The extensive abuse of chemical synthetic additives has raised increased attention to food safety. As substitutes, probiotics play an important role in human health as they balance the intestinal microbes in host. This study was aimed to isolate and evaluate the potential probiotic activities of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from a local pickled leaf mustard (PLM) from Wuwei city in Anhui province through in vitro experiments. A total of 17 LAB strains were obtained as probiotics. All the isolates were sensitive to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, and doxycycline but exhibited resistance to antibiotics (e.g., streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and vancomycin). Out of the 17 strains, 9 were sensitive to most of the antibiotics and had no cytotoxic activity on human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HT-29) cells. The isolated AWP4 exhibited antibacterial activity against four indicator pathogen strains (ATCC8099: Escherichia coli, ATCC6538: Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC9120: Salmonella enteric, and BNCC192105: Shigella sonnei). Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, AWP4 belonged to Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. This study indicated that the Wuwei local PLM could be a potential resource to isolate beneficial LAB as probiotics. The data provide theoretical guidance for further animal experiments to estimate the probiotic effect and safety of Lpb. plantarum AWP4 in vivo.</field>

		<field name="AB">Oral colon targeted mini-tablets containing 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) were developed by using guar gum, pectin and Eudragit S100. Probiotics were co-administered to constantly replenish the gut microflora of colon that gets damaged due to pathophysiology of cancer and side effect of 5-FU. Replacement of microbial count ensures that the polysachharide used for sustaining the drug release gets digested to release the drug, once the formulation reaches the colon. The site-specific release of coated tablets was confirmed by dissolution studies in medium containing rat caecal contents (RCC), wherein, the formulation containing Eudragit S100, pectin and guar gum in the ratio of 04:03:03 w/w, showed less than 10% drug release in initial 5 h and immediate burst release (100%) between 5th to 10th hour. The cell line studies carried for pooled dissolution samples indicated that more than 90% cells were viable in all the cases till 5th hour. Significant (p &lt; 0.05) decline in cellular viability was observed in case of coated mini tablets as compared to un-coated one. The pharmacokinetic studies showed a lower as well as delayed plasma concentration in the coated formulations endorsing the original hypothesis of reduction in drug exposure of the non-target sites.</field>

		<field name="AB">Groups of 15 female rats were fed ad libitum for 4 weeks with a standard diet containing 0, 2.5, 5 or 10% of a dietary fibre (DF) preparation made on a laboratory scale from sugar beet pulp. This preparation had a total DF content of 72.2%. its major components were 36.7% cellulose, 16.9% pectin. 16.8% hemicelluloses (WC) and 11.0% protein. The DF preparation from sugar beet exhibited a water-binding capacity (WBC) of 8.9 g H2O/g. As the proportion of DF preparation in the diet increased, up to 15.8% total DF, 4.6% cellulose and 1.9% pectin were found in the feeds. The WBC of the diets was estimated to be 1.4-2.9 g H2O/g. At the end of the experiment, 20.3-64.1% total DF, 10.3-38.2% cellulose. 0.2-7.8% pectin, 4.3-9.2% HC pentoses and 4.3-10.3% HC hexoses were determined in caecum contents (ca. 0.6 g dry weight/rat). The following proportions were found in faeces (3rd week: 1.4-1.9 dry weight/rat): 34.5-56.9% total DF, 19.5-36.1% cellulose, 6.4-8.4% HC pentoses, 7.4-8.3% HC hexoses. The WBC of faeces ranged from 3.7 g H2O/g to 4.9 g H2O/g. About 30-50% of the daily intake of DF appeared in the faeces. Higher amounts of total DF, pectin and I-TC pentoses were fermented by gastrointestinal microflora as the concentration of DF preparation fi-om sugar beet in the diet increased. In addition, the fermentation of different DF components could be shown by the monosaccharide composition of caecum contents and faeces.</field>

		<field name="AB">The aim of a chronotherapeutic medicine is to tailor drug in vivo availability to circadian rhythms of diseases in order to reduce side effects and improve patient compliance. To counteract morning symptoms of early morning pathologies, a drug delivery system able to delay ketoprofen release after oral administration has been proposed. Particles made of a pectin matrix were produced by means of prilling; core-shell systems were produced covering the drug particles with Eudragit S100 (R). The systems developed, containing different drug/polymer ratios, were fully characterized in terms of drug content, efficiency of encapsulation, morphology and drug release kinetics. The results indicated that the loading of larger amounts of drug in the feed solution led to spherical and mono-disperse beads, with high encapsulation efficiency and a reduced drug delivery in gastric simulated fluids (22%). Finally, a further delay of drug release (7.3% released in simulated gastric fluid) was achieved applying to the drug/pectin core a shell of Eudragit S100 (R) (40% w/w) a gastro-resistant polymer. This core-shell platform exploits the different characteristics of the two selected polymers, i.e. pH dependent solubility of Eudragit S100 (R) and the peculiarities of pectin, degraded slowly in alkaline environment and selectively by the intestinal microflora in vivo.

		<field name="AB">Propolis and oregano oil are natural substances used in various food industry applications. An evaluation was done of the effects of oregano oil (A) and propolis (P) on production parameters, leukocytes, blood chemistry and meat antioxidant stability in broilers. Animals (n = 480) were randomly allocated to four treatments with four replicates of 30 animals each. Four additive levels (mg/k feed) were tested: C (control) = 0; P = 100 mg propolis; A = 100 mg oregano oil; and AP = 50 mg P + 50 mg A. At 42 d breast meat lipid oxidative stability was estimated based on malondialdehyde (MDA) content. The oregano oil contained 43.47% thymol and 29.16 % carvacrol, while the propolis contained 5.6 mg flavonoids, 840 mu g phenols and 138 mu g Trolox (R) equivalents (antioxidant stability) per gram. Feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion and mortality were unaffected by the dietary additives. At 3 wk, blood eosinophil levels increased in treatment AP (P &lt;= 0.05), and at 6 wk triglycerides had increased in treatment A (P &lt;= 0.05). Meat lipid oxidative stability decreased in the AP treatment (P &lt;= 0.05). Neither oregano oil nor propolis improved production parameters, although they can stimulate immune response. When added to low-fat broiler diets they can increase blood triglycerides and in combination they compromise breast meat lipid oxidative stability.</field>

		<field name="AB">The possibility of gastric acid hydrolysis of inulin was investigated in feeding experiments with rats receiving diets containing 5% inulin (dahlia tubers). An antibiotic drug, Nebacitin, was administered in the diet to suppress the hind-gut microflora. The rats were divided into two groups-one reference group, and one test group which, in addition to the Nebacitin treatment, was given daily doses of Omeprazol to inhibit gastric acid secretion. The pure inulin and preparations of faeces from the reference and test group, respectively, were chromatographed using a Sephadex G-15 column. The elution pattern indicated that the inulin recovered in faeces from the reference group was significantly depolymerized, whereas only minor fragmentation occurred during passage through the gastro-intestinal tract of animals with experimental achlorhydria. These results show that inulin was hydrolyzed under the acidic conditions prevailing in the rat stomach. Liberation of fructose through gastric hydrolysis is suggested as a mechanism by which a small fraction of inulin may be rendered available for digestion and absorption in the rat small intestine.</field>

		<field name="AB">Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are important causes of diarrhoea and the haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The most common STEC serotype implicated worldwide is E. coli O157:H7 that is diagnosed using procedures based on its typical phenotypic feature, the lack of sorbitol fermentation. In addition to E. coli O157:H7, a variety of non-O157:H7 STEC strains that usually ferment sorbitol and are thus missed by using the diagnostic protocol for E. coli O157:H7 have been isolated from patients. Among these sorbitol-fermenting (SF) non-O157:H7 STEC, SF E. coli O157:H(-) and non-O157 STEC strains of serogroups O26, O103, O111 and O145 have emerged as significant causes of HUS and diarrhoea in continental Europe and have been associated with human disease in other parts of the world. Microbiological diagnosis of non-O157:H7 STEC strains is difficult due to their serotype diversity and the absence of a simple biochemical property that distinguishes such strains from the physiological intestinal microflora. Screening for non-O157:H7 STEC and their isolation from stools is presently based on the detection of Stx production or stx genes that are common characteristics of such strains. Molecular subtyping of the most frequent non-O157 STEC demonstrated that strains of serogroups O26, O103 and O111 belong to their own clonal lineages and show unique virulence profiles. SF STEC O157:H- strains that have been isolated mostly in Central Europe represent a new clone within E. coli O157 serogroup which has its own typical combination of virulence factors.</field>

		<field name="AB">As a functional additive for intestinal microflora, panose (6(2)-alpha-D-glucopyranosylmaltose) was synthesized during kimchi fermentation using the glucose transferring reaction of glucansucrase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides. For the glucose transferring reaction, sucrose and maltose were added (2% each, w/v) to dongchimi-kimchi as the glucosyl donor and acceptor molecule, respectively. After five days of incubation at 10degreesC, referring to the initial phase for the production of lactic acid in kimchi, over 60% (w/v) of the total sugars were converted into panose and other branched oligosaccharides. Thereafter, the kimchi was stored at 4degreesC and the amount of panose remained at a constant level for three weeks, thereby indicating the stability of panose to microbial degradation during the period of kimchi consumption. The use of maltose as the acceptor molecule in the kimchi also facilitated a lower viscosity in the kimchi-juice by preventing the synthesis of a dextran-like polymer which caused an unfavorable taste. Accordingly, the application of this new method of simultaneous biocatalytic synthesis of oligosaccharides during lactate fermentation should facilitate the extensive development of new function-added lactate foods.</field>

		<field name="AB">Abdominal obesity is the most prevalent manifestation of metabolic syndrome. The anti-obese effects of dietary fiber is generally accepted, but specifically the anti-obese properties of the dietary fiber, gum arabic (GA) has not been well studied. In this investigation, we offered GA to the female 90 days old mice in the form of drink (1% w/v) for 180 days. Such GA in drinking water reduced age-dependent fat deposition in the visceral adipose tissue and improved the gastrocnemius muscle reduction. This inhibition of fat deposition effect is due to the beta 3-adrenergic stimulation of adipocytes in which TNF alpha down-regulation is probably involved. Modification of large intestinal microflora, as evidenced by a modification of cecal short-chain fatty acid profile and of 16S rDNA profile, may contribute to such reduction in TNF alpha expression in the adipose tissues.

		<field name="AB">The probiotic effect of Lactobacillus brevis (MTCC 4463) was studied on promotion of survival and growth, enhancement of contents of biochemical constituents and activities of digestive enzymes and establishment of its colony in the gut of Macrobrachium rosenbergii post-larvae (PL). Four groups of PL (1.62 +/- 0.08 cm length and 0.06 +/- 0.01 g weight), each consisting of 35 PL were maintained with 25 L of ground water and fed ad libitum with 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% of L. brevis incorporated artificial diets respectively for a period of 90 days. Diet without incorporation of L. brevis was served as control. L. brevis was found to be alive in the feed even on day-15 after it was formulated. On day-90, survival, nutritional indices (weight gain, specific growth rate, food conversion ratio and protein efficiency ratio), activities of digestive enzymes (protease, amylase and lipase), concentrations of basic biochemical constituents (total protein, amino acid, carbohydrate and lipid), levels of essential amino acids and fatty acids were found to be significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased when compared with control. These effects were found to be the best with 1% of L. brevis incorporated diet fed PL, better with 0.5% L. brevis and good with 1.5% L. brevis when compared to control. The staining intensity of 59, 52, 43, 37, 29, 27, 24, 21, 20, 18, 17, 15 and 14 kDa polypeptide bands were found to be increased in the experimental PL when compared with control. The biochemical confirmation tests revealed presence of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp., Streptococcus spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the gut of control PL whereas in the gut of experimental PL, in addition to the presence of E. coli, Pseudomonas spp. and Streptococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., Bacillus spp. and Clostridium butyricum were detected, but K. pneumonia was excluded. The MTTC supplied L. brevis (MTCC 4463) when subjected to subculture showed that it contains 1516 bp DNA, which exactly matched with L. brevis sequence data available with NCBI data base. The established microbe sequence (1506 bp DNA) in the gut of control PL was 97% matched with Serratia sp. The sequence (1537 bp DNA) of dominant microbe established in the gut of M. rosenbergii PL fed with L. brevis incorporated feed was 99% matched with Lactobacillus sp. Therefore, in this study, incorporated probiotic colony establishment was confirmed up to genus level only. As L. brevis (1%) incorporated diet produced better survival and growth, it can be recommended as feed additive for sustainable production of Macrobrachium.</field>

		<field name="AB">Dietary fiber may affect the development of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and the breast. The biological intermediates studied most have been fecal bile acids; both human and animal studies suggest a tumor-promoting role of bile acids in the development of colon tumors, although there are conflicting data from human studies. Short-chain fatty acids are major fermentation products of bacterial degradation of dietary fiber. If short-chain fatty acids explained the tumor-inhibiting properties of dietary fiber, the readily fermentable fibers such as guar and pectin would be more protective than cellulose and wheat bran, which has not been observed. Because these two hypotheses do not adequately explain modulation of tumor growth by dietary fiber, investigation of other intermediates is indicated. These include physical characteristics of the feces, such as abrasiveness; intestinal microflora; aqueous-phase bile acids, which may represent the bioavailable pool; alterations in mucins; mutagenicity of intestinal contents; alterations in mucosal cytokinetics; activities of enzymes, such as ornithine decarboxylase or aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase; neurogenic effects caused by changes in intestinal bulk or short-chain fatty acids; gut hormones or other peptide growth factors (local or systemic); enterohepatic circulation of hormones; transit time; pH; or decreased availability of total dietary energy.</field>

		<field name="AB">Probiotics can effectively regulate flora balance in the human gut microflora environment. Spent mushroom substrate contains a variety of nutrients. With fermentation of lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, yeast and other probiotics, probiotic nutrient solution was obtained from fermentation liquid of digester liquid of Flammulina velutiper spent mushroom substrate. Nutrients, the total number of probiotics, and food safety of probiotic nutrient solution were measured. The results showed that nutrients of probiotic nutrition solution obtained from the residue of F. velutiper spent mushroom substrate, such as mineral, sugars, protein, fat, were rich. The total number of probiotic bacteria was 2.3x10(6) CFU/mL. There was no heavy metals including arsenic, mercury and bacterium pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes in probiotic nutrition solution. The content of rest heavy metal and the total number of rest bacteria did not exceed the national standard limit indicators.</field>

		<field name="AB">Effects of administration of 4G-beta-D-galactosylsucrose (lactosucrose: LS) on fecal microflora, putrefactive products, short-chain fatty acids, weight, moisture and pH, and subjective sensation of defecation were investigated in 13 elderly patients with constipation. The LS mixture used in the present study consisted of LS (59.0%), lactose (22.7%), sucrose (8.4%), fructose (1.6%), glucose (6.8%), and non-identified polysaccharides (0.8%). Subjects were fed 0.32 g of LS mixture per kg body weight per day (0. 18 g of LS per kg body weight per day) for 3 weeks after a one-week control period. The results obtained were as follows: 1. The number and percentage of Bifidobacterium remarkably increased. The frequency of occurrence of Bifidobacterium increased, while that of lecithinase-negative Clostridium decreased. 2. The concentrations of p-cresol, indole, skatole and ammonia in the feces (nmol or mumol/g wet feces) were decreased significantly, and the total fecal excretion of p-cresol and skatole(mumol/week) was also diminished significantly. 3. LS administration caused significant increases in the concentration (mumol/g wet feces) and the total fecal excretion (mmol/week) of acetic and n-butyric acids. 4. Fecal moisture (%) increased significantly, whereas fecal pH decreased. LS also tented to cause a gain in fecal weight (g/week). 5. The stool of patient was softened. The subjective sensation of defecation was improved in 11 out of the 13 patients and unchanged in 2 of them. These results suggest that LS ingestion corrects the fecal condition through improvement of the intestinal microflora.</field>

		<field name="AB">A mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) specific to the vegetative cell of Clostridium butyricum strain MIYAIRI 588 (CBM588) was produced by immunisation with whole vegetative cells. This MAb (MAb-MS35) recognised a 35 KDa surface protein on CBM588 and did not cross-react with other intestinal bacteria including 16 strains of C. butyricum. A close correlation was observed between CBM588 vegetative cell counts in rat faeces and enzyme-licked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) values using MAb-MS35. Consequently, this ELISA was used to specifically determine the concentrations of CBM588 in the faeces of rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the fate of CBM588 in the rat gastrointestinal tract after a single oral administration. CBM588 spores were administered intragastrically at 10(7) cells per rat, and the faeces of each rat were collected twice daily. CBM588 vegetative cells were detected in the faeces for 3 d after administration. Total recovery of CBM588 vegetative cells from faeces were three to six times the spore dose. In addition, CBM588 vegetative cells were observed microscopically using faecal smears and an immunogold-silver staining method with MAb-MS35. These findings indicate that CBM588 spores germinate and the vegetative cells multiply in the gastrointestinal tract of rats.</field>

		<field name="AB">Bacterial microbes play a vital role in the nutrition and health of birds. Food passaging through the gastrointestinal tract of poultry favored microflora that have rapid growth and can adhering to the mucosal wall. The caeca are ideal habitats for diverse bacteria with effect on the host nutrition and health. Antibiotics in poultry for therapeutic and as growth promotor can decrease the number of most susceptible bacterial communities and enhance the growth of resistant bacteria. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of garlic and onion extract chitosan nanoparticles on the intestinal microflora of Rainbow Rooster Indigenous Chicken in Kenya in which a total of 18 chickens were used with 2 chickens drawn from each of the 9 groups and both caecum and jejunum content sampled with a total of 36 samples. The chickens were treated with Chitosan and Aqueous extracts of Garlic and Onion (CHIAGO), Chitosan with total Phenol, Ajoene rich extract (CHITPA) nanoparticles, and Chitosan Solution (CHISOLN) all at 5% and 10% and 1 g and 0.5 g Fosbac (Antibiotic) were applied orally to the chickens twice a week for 8 weeks. About 1.5 g of caecum and jejunum contents for micro-organisms Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella typhi (S. typhi), Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus), Bifidobactreum bifidium (B. bifidium) from caecum and L. acidophilus from jejunum were analyzed at 8th week of the treatment using conventional PCR to optimize bacteria 16S rRNA gene specific bands and qPCR for the 16S rRNA gene copy numbers was determined. Lactobacillus acidophilus, E. coli , S. typhi, C. jejuni from caecum and L. acidophilus from jejunum indicated specific bands in 1.2% agarose gel. The qPCR revealed primers efficiency in most of the assay with exception of the jejunum L. acidophilus assay. There was a significant differences among the treatments for L. acidophilus (p &lt; 0.0001), E. coli (p &lt; 0.0001), S. typhi (p &lt; 0.0001), C. jejuni (p &lt; 0.1059) in caecum and jejunum L. acidophilus at (p &lt;= 0.0001) for 16S rRNA gene copy numbers mu g/mu l DNA in 1.5 g of caecum and jejunum content. The results indicated normal percentage for caecum L. acidophilus to jejunium L. acidophilus at 96.65-87.63%, 90.27% to 35% was shown in L. acidophilus to E. coli, L. acidophilus to C. jejuni was 99.97% to 95.94% and low percentage of L. acidophilus to S. typhi 16S rRNA gene copy numbers after the treatment with CHITPA and CHIAGO.

		<field name="AB">Aquaculture is viewed as an important and critical food production sector and this sector plays an important role in ensuring nutritional and food security of growing global population. Mariculture is one of the growing production activities in the Arabian countries. Kuwait institute for Scientific Research boasts of the earliest break-through in the captive breeding and larval rearing technologies of important mariculture species such as grouper, bluefin bream, silver pomfret and the yellowfin breams. Intensification of the mariculture activity has to be managed keeping in view the high probability of diseases in such systems. Antibiotic interventions tire routinely practiced in the larval rearing of marine fish for enhancing survival and reducing the losses due to diseases. Due to the primitiveness of immune competence at the Younger ages of the marine fish, probiotics provide an effective alternative to antibiotics thus, obliterating the possible antibiotic contamination of the environment and development of multiple antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. However, the science of probiotics in aquaculture is in its infancy Many of the probiotics employed in aquaculture are either developed for human use (Lactobacillus spp.) or for the veterinary use (Bacillus spp.). But, the use of these probiotics in aquatic environment that is more diverse than the terrestrial environment and in fish that has varying gut environments, has resulted in a high degree of variability in the outcome. Isolation, characterization and commercialization of autochthonous probiotic bacteria, therefore, need to be addressed. Several studies have shown that autochthonous marine bacteria from the gut of fish have a higher resident time even after the withdrawal of the probiotic feeding. Probiotic bacteria isolated from different marine fish (cultured and wild population) of Kuwait have shown varying capacities of inhibiting pathogenic vibrios reflecting on the scope for further research in this direction. In this paper, the preliminary experimental results obtained at Mariculture and Fisheries Department of Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research are discussed in the light of aquaculture probiotic research accomplishments made world over.</field>
